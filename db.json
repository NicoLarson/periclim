      "abstract": "Logging is widespread in tropical regions, with approximately 50% of all humid tropical forests (1.73 × 109 ha) regarded as production forests. To maintain the ecosystem functions of carbon sequestration and timber supply in tropical production forests over a long term, forest management must be sustainable under changing climate conditions. Individual-based forest models are useful tools to enhance our understanding about the long-term effects of harvest and climate change on forest dynamics because they link empirical field data with simulations of ecological processes. The objective of this study is to analyze the combined effects of selective logging and climate change on biomass stocks and timber harvest in a tropical forest in French Guiana. By applying a forest model, we simulated natural forest dynamics under the baseline scenario of current climate conditions and compared the results with scenarios of selective logging under climate change. The analyses revealed how substantially forest dynamics are altered under different scenarios of climate change. (1) Repeated logging within recovery times decreased biomass and timber harvest, irrespective of the intensity of climate change. (2) With moderate climate change as envisaged by the 5th IPCC Assessment Report (representative concentration pathway 2.6), the average biomass remained the same as in the baseline scenario (−1%), but with intensive climate change (RCP 8.5), the average biomass decreased by 12%. (3) The combination of selective logging and climate change increased the likelihood of changes in forest dynamics, driven mainly by rising temperatures. Under RCP 8.5, the average timber harvest was almost halved, regardless of the logging cycle applied. An application-oriented use of forest models will help to identify opportunities to reduce the effects of unwanted ecosystem changes in a changing environment. To ensure that ecosystem functions in production forests are maintained under climate change conditions, appropriate management strategies will help to maintain biomass and harvest in production forests.",

      "abstract": "Climate change and biological invasion are major threats to biodiversity, but their combined effects have rarely been quantified. The introduction of congeneric non-native species, in particular, can be especially problematic for native species due to competition and hybridization. Here, we quantify the impacts of climate change on the distribution of an ecologically and economically important native species, Euterpe edulis, and on the invasion potential of its congeneric E. oleracea, across the Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot. We modelled current and future environmental suitability for both species, using a comprehensive set of algorithms and climatic scenarios, and quantified the extent of overlap of their environmentally suitable areas. Climate change reduced environmental suitability for E. edulis, but had neutral effects on E. oleracea. Current and future overlap areas, where competition and hybridization are more likely, were concentrated mostly in the southeastern region of Brazil. Our results suggest that native and non-native congeneric species respond differently to climate change, and that climate change and the introduction of E. oleracea are additional threats to the threatened E. edulis. We recommend avoiding new introductions of E. oleracea especially in the southeastern portion of the Atlantic Forest, and the maintenance of protected areas especially in the southern region.",

      "abstract": "Species exposed to anthropogenic climate change can acclimate, adapt, move, or be extirpated. It is often assumed that movement will be the dominant response, with populations tracking their climate envelopes in space, but the numerous species restricted to specialized substrates cannot easily move. In warmer regions of the world, such edaphic specialists appear to have accumulated in situ over millions of years, persisting despite climate change by local movements, plastic responses, and genetic adaptation. However, past climates were usually cooler than today and rates of warming slower, while edaphic islands are now exposed to multiple additional threats, including mining. Modeling studies that ignore edaphic constraints on climate change responses may therefore give misleading results for a significant proportion of all taxa.",

      "abstract": "The scarcity of data on natural history and ecology of lizards still limits the understanding of population dynamics for many species. We attempt to evaluate possible effects of climate change on the population dynamics of three lizard species (Ameiva ameiva, Gonatodes humeralis and Norops fuscoauratus) in two Amazonian localities (Caxiuanã National Forest and Ducke Reserve). We calculated a tolerance index combining environmental thermal adequacy with the b-d model, which consider survival and reproductive rates to calculate population dynamics. Thus, we simulated population growth rates based on current and future environmental operative temperatures, considering an optimistic and a business-as-usual scenario of greenhouse gases emissions (GGE), and evaluate if the sensitivity of life history traits to population growth rate are likely to be trigged by climate change. Our results demonstrated that both populations of G. humeralis and the Ducke population of N. fuscoauratus may become locally extinct under both scenarios of GGE, while both populations of A. ameiva are likely to decrease, but without reaching a scenario of local extirpation. This study represents the first effort to evaluate the sensitivity of lizard populations and elasticity to climate change and demonstrate the geographic variability of these traits in three widespread and habitat-generalist species. We highlight the need of new studies focusing on species with different biological trait patterns, such as endemic distributions and habitat-specialists, to provide the theoretical and empirical basis for biologically informed conservation strategies and actions, in order to minimize the potential extinction of populations due to climate change.",

      "abstract": "Background Tropical forests cover less than 10 per cent of all land area (1.8 × 107 km2) and over half of the tropical-forest area (1.1 × 107 Km2) is represented by humid tropical forests (also called tropical rainforests). The Amazon basin contains the largest rainforest on Earth, almost 5.8 million km2, and occupies about 40% of South America; more than 60% of the basin is located in Brazil and the rest in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela. Over the past decade the positive role of tropical rainforests in capturing large amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) has been demonstrated. In response to the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration, tropical forests act as a global carbon sink. Main body Accumulation of carbon in the tropical terrestrial biosphere strongly contributes to slowing the rate of increase of CO2 into the atmosphere, thus resulting in the reduction of greenhouse gas effect. Tropical rainforests have been estimated to account for 32–36% of terrestrial Net Primary Productivity (NPP) that is the difference between total forest photosynthesis and plant respiration. Tropical rainforests have been acting as a strong carbon sink in this way for decades. However, over the past years, increased concentrations of greenhouse gases, and especially CO2, in the atmosphere have significantly affected the net carbon balance of tropical rainforests, and have warmed the planet substantially driving climate changes through more severe and prolonged heat waves, variability in temperature, increased air pollution, forest fires, droughts, and floods. The role of tropical forests in mitigating climate change is therefore critical. Over the past 30 years almost 600,000 km2 have been deforested in Brazil alone due to the rapid development of Amazonia, this is the reason why currently the region is one of the ‘hotspots’ of global environmental change on the planet. Conclusion Deforestation represents the second largest anthropogenic source of CO2 to the atmosphere, after fossil fuel combustion. There are many causes of deforestation, including socioeconomic and natural factors, such as clear-cutting for agriculture, ranching and development, unsustainable logging for timber, as well as droughts, fires and degradation due to climate change. About natural causes of forest degradation, in the context of the Amazon, the major agent of change in the forest ecosystem would most likely be decreased dry-season precipitation. Of the 23 global climate models employed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in their 2007 report, 50–70% predict a substantial (above 20%) reduction of dry-season rainfall in eastern Amazonia under mid-range greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, 40% in central Amazonia and 20% in the west. While annual carbon emissions from fossil-fuel combustion have been continually increasing since 1960s, historical trends of deforestation and associated carbon emissions have remained poorly understood.",

      "abstract": "Carryover effects occur when an individual's experience during one stage of the annual cycle influences their behaviour in subsequent stages. This includes stages of the annual cycle, such as migration, when behaviour, such as departure timing, is also affected by circannual and circadian cues. In birds, the initiation of autumn migratory movements is often related to the timing of the cessation of the breeding season. However, less is known as to whether breeding season carryover effects also affect the pace of migration. To determine whether there are carryover effects from the breeding season to migration in barn swallows, Hirundo rustica, we monitored nests and used the Motus Wildlife Tracking System to determine migratory departure date-partss and the pace of migration. Barn swallows that finished breeding later in the summer initiated migration later and migrated faster through North America than swallows that finished breeding earlier in the summer. However, daily flight speeds were unrelated to the timing of the breeding season, suggesting that late-departing individuals increased their overall pace by reducing stopovers. Our results suggest that although barn swallows do not establish a nonbreeding territory, there are constraints during migration that require late-departing individuals to compensate for carryover effects from the breeding season. Late departure is not necessarily disadvantageous if individuals are able to ‘catch-up’ to early-departing individuals, but more work is needed to assess whether late departure and the faster pace of migration affect the subsequent survival of these individuals.",

      "abstract": "Rainfall erosivity is the driving factor for soil erosion and can be potentially affected by climate change, impacting agriculture and the environment. In this study, we sought to project the impact of climate change on the long-term average annual rainfall erosivity (R-factor) and mean annual precipitation in South America. The CanESM2, HadGEM2-ES, and MIROC5 global circulation models (GCMs) and the average of the GCMs (GCM-Ensemble) downscaled by the Eta/CPTEC model at a spatial resolution of 20 km in the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 were applied in this study. A geographical model to estimate the R-factor across South America was fitted. This model was based on latitude, longitude, altitude, and mean annual precipitation as inputs obtained from the WorldClim database. Using this model, the first R-factor map for South America was developed (for the baseline period: 1961–2005). The GCMs projected mean annual precipitation for three 30-year time periods (time slices: 2010–2040; 2041–2070; 2071–2099). These projections were used to run the R-factor model to assess the impact of climate change. It was observed that the changes were more pronounced in the Amazon Forest region (namely, the North Region, NR, and the Andes North Region, ANR) with a strong reduction in the mean annual precipitation and R-factor throughout the century. The highest increase in the R-factor was projected on the Central and South Andes regions (CAR and SAR) because of the increase in the mean annual precipitation projected by the GCMs. The GCMs pointed contradictory projections for the Central-South Region (CSR), indicating greater uncertainty. An increase in the R-factor was projected for this region, eastern Argentina, and southern Brazil, whereas a decrease in the R-factor was expected for southeastern Brazil. In general, the GCMs projected reductions in the R-factor and annual precipitation for South America, with the highest changes projected from the baseline to the 2010–2040 time slice.",

      "abstract": "Production of French Polynesia's black pearls is entirely dependent on oceanic conditions. Yet, conditions are changing due to climate change. This research evaluates the potential economic consequences of increased seawater temperature on black pearl production. A stochastic-dynamic bioeconomic simulation simulated the growth of oysters and pearl quality under current and projected seawater temperatures in 2035 in the Northern Tuamotu Archipelago. Production strategies, including grafting intensity, grafting timeframe, and overall pearl quality distribution were included in the simulation to identify production strategies which maximized net present value (NPV) over ten-years. Across all simulated management scenarios, production occurring under projected seawater temperatures resulted in an average decline of 29.1% in expected NPV. Overall, the change in expected NPV stemmed from a decline in the quantity of pearls produced, decline in the quality of pearls produced, and an increase in time between production stages. The optimal production strategy for current and projected seawater temperatures across all management scenarios was to graft a whole cohort of oysters in December with the best possible pearl quality distribution. However, with production occurring with other pearl quality distributions, optimal grafting timeframe and intensity differs between temperature regimes.

      "abstract": "Tropical forests are facing threats that may affect the dynamics of seed dispersers which participate in the forest regeneration. To implement appropriate conservation programs, it appears necessary to monitor seed dispersers and to estimate their response to local changes. Here, we used non-invasive ecoacoustic methods to monitor the activity of a canopy bird, the White-throated toucan, Ramphastos tucanus, a major seed disperser and flagship species of the Amazonian forest. We deployed nine acoustic recorders over 29 days along a road that connects French Guiana to Brazil. We used template matching to automatically detect the vocalizations of R. tucanus. This method, which can easily be repeated with limited human expertise, detected 1748 recordings with R. tucanus vocalizations. A GLMM analysis was applied to test for a possible effect of habitat type and human activity, while accounting for time of the day and rainfall. The number of vocalizations varied according to time of the day with peaks at dawn and dusk. The number of vocalizations did not differ significantly among sites, they were not affected by habitat type, and they were only marginally influenced by human activity. These results indicate that the vocal activity of a key conservation species can be monitored automatically in a non-invasive way. The species targeted, R. tucanus, does not seem to be significantly impacted by the road and local human activity. This might be related to the mobility of the species, which can easily cross the road, as well as low local forestry pressure.",

      "abstract": "The remineralization of organic carbon (OC) in marine sediments has crucial implications for global carbon cycling and climate change. However, OC turnover rates differ significantly owing to complex spatiotemporal variations in sediment depositional conditions. This review discusses the dominant methodologies through laboratory or in situ methods to measure oxygen consumption or dissolved inorganic carbon production rates to assess OC remineralization rates. The influencing factors in marine sediments are briefly described, including characteristics of OC interactions with the sediment matrix, redox effect, temperature, and biotic activities. Lastly, we provide a comparison of the OC remineralization rates among near-shore (0–50 m), continental shelf and slope (50–2000 m), deep sea (2000–6000 m), and trench (>6000 m) sediments. The remineralization rates generally decreased with distance from the continent, excluding the trench region. While conditions such as redox oscillation, nutrient input, and temperature were severely influenced by global warming and human activities on large scales, reactions between OC and degradation functional genes of microorganisms helped to reveal the microbial scale of sedimentary OC remineralization. Thus, it is pivotal to understand both the processes of OC remineralization and the underlying mechanisms in marine sediments.",

      "abstract": "Tree mode of death provides insights as to why soil and topography explain only about 25% of the spatial variation in tree mortality in Central Amazonia, and permit predictions about what types of mortality are most probable under climate change. We studied tree mortality by mode of death in 72 1-ha permanent plots spanning 64km2 of tropical moist forest in Reserva Ducke, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil. Plots were re-censused twice (2003–2005 and 2005–2008). Tree mode of death was assigned for trees ⩾4cm dbh as standing, uprooted or snapped. We also recorded whether trees died alone or were pushed over by treefalls. Standing death was predominant, representing 54% of deaths of trees with dbh⩾10cm, followed by snapping (26%) and uprooting (14%). Trees that fell alone represented 25% of deaths, while 16% were pushed over. Most small fallen dead trees (4⩽dbh<30cm) were pushed over by other trees, while most large dead trees (dbh⩾30cm) died alone. Standing mortality was weakly related to soil and topography, but 20% of variation in uprooted mortality and 11% in snapped mortality of trees with dbh⩾10cm was explained by soil and topography. The variation in mortality explained for small trees (18% for uprooted mortality and 13% for snapped mortality) was higher than for large trees (14% for mortality by snapping only). In spite of little variation in mortality associated directly with soil and slope, analyses assessing the effect of topographic categories (plateaux, slope, and valley) on tree mortality detected higher differences, even though causal factors remain unidentified because topographic position may encompass both topographic and soil properties. There was an increase from the first to the second census interval in the effects associated with soil and topography on tree mortality by uprooting and snapping, and this was likely due to storms, which led to a disproportional increase in tree mortality for these tree modes of death. Presently, uprooting and snapping mortality are not dominant and the use of soil and topographic variables for modeling of tree mortality is therefore limited. However, under predicted climate-change scenarios of higher frequency of extreme storms, soil and topography may become more useful to improve estimates of tree mortality and biomass losses over large areas in Amazonia.",

      "abstract": "The ongoing coronavirus disease 19s pandemic has yet again demonstrated the importance of the human-animal interface in the emergence of zoonotic diseases, and in particular the role of wildlife and livestock species as potential hosts and virus reservoirs. As most diseases emerge out of the human-animal interface, a better understanding of the specific drivers and mechanisms involved is crucial to prepare for future disease outbreaks. Interactions between wildlife and livestock systems contribute to the emergence of zoonotic diseases, especially in the face of globalization, habitat fragmentation and destruction and climate change. As several groups of viruses and bacteria are more likely to emerge, we focus on pathogenic viruses of the Bunyavirales, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, and Paramyxoviridae, as well as bacterial species including Mycobacterium sp., Brucella sp., Bacillus anthracis and Coxiella burnetii. Noteworthy, it was difficult to predict the drivers of disease emergence in the past, even for well-known pathogens. Thus, an improved surveillance in hotspot areas and the availability of fast, effective, and adaptable control measures would definitely contribute to preparedness. We here propose strategies to mitigate the risk of emergence and/or re-emergence of prioritized pathogens to prevent future epidemics.",

The results of this case study illustrate the cost effectiveness of alternative land-use options that reduce deforestation and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This analysis demonstrates that using Guyana's rainforests for climate change mitigation can generate equivalent revenue to that of conventional large-scale logging without detrimental environmental impacts. At a 12% discount rate, the break-even price for carbon is estimated to be about US$ 0.20/tC. This estimate falls toward the low range of carbon prices for existing carbon offset projects that avoid deforestation.",

In this extensive approach, the Sr and Mg contents are well correlated and both are partly related to agricultural and weathering inputs.

      "abstract": "Drought events may induce mangrove mortality and dieback events worldwide as a result of climate extremes. As mangroves sequester large quantities of carbon, quantifying the losses of these stocks following climate disturbances may guide wetland governance strategies globally. In Southeast Brazil, we determined the total ecosystem carbon stocks (TECS) of pristine mangroves that were up to 1851 Mg of carbon per hectare (Mg C ha−1), which are the highest stocks measured from South American and raising estimates of Brazil's mangrove TECS to 0.52 Pg C. A mangrove mortality event in the same estuary resulted in a 14.6 % decrease in TECS (270.5 Mg C ha−1) and loss of 20 % of mangrove soil carbon within less than 2-years. Carbon dioxide emissions from this impact were 992.8 Mg CO2e ha−1, which are slightly lower than emissions from land use disturbances on mangroves worldwide. Our results suggest that climate effects on mangroves can become significant sources of greenhouse gases globally.",

      "abstract": "This article reviews the level of current scientific understanding regarding the impact of future change in the large-scale climate-earth system on ecosystem services. Impacts from sea level rise, ocean acidification, increases in ocean temperature, potential collapse of the thermohaline circulation; failure of the South Asia monsoon; the melting of sea ice, the Greenland Ice Sheet and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet; changes in water availability; and Amazonia forest dieback, are considered. The review highlights that while a number of uncertainties remain in understanding, there is evidence to suggest that climate change may have already affected some ecosystem services. Furthermore, there is considerable evidence to show that future climate change could have impacts on biodiversity, as well as secondary impacts on issues important to human society, including; habitability; land productivity and food security; water security; and potential economic impacts.",

      "abstract": "In democracies around the world, societies have demonstrated that elections can have major consequences for the environment. In Colombia, the 2022 presidential elections will take place at a time when progress towards peace has stalled and socioeconomic, security, and environmental conditions have deteriorated. The recent declines in these conditions largely coincide with the change of government after the 2018 elections, and the associated rise to power of a party that boycotted the peace negotiations from the beginning. These indicators suggest that 2018 marked the end of a decade of improvements in safety, wealth, and equality—societal factors that can interact with the environment in multiple ways. A spike in assassinations of land and environmental defenders in 2019 and 2020 made Colombia one of the most dangerous places in the world for environmentalists. With the 2022 presidential election, Colombians will once again decide who will govern the country and what new social, economic, and environmental policies will be implemented. In preparation for elections like this, we believe that it is important for scientists with relevant backgrounds to highlight relationships between political events and the environment, to enrich the political debate, help prioritize public resources, and inform policy-making. Here, we provide a multidisciplinary analysis of different socioeconomic and environmental trends that can help inform the public and decision-makers. We intend for this analysis to be useful not only in Colombia, but also to other societies under similar situations, managing biodiversity-rich ecosystems in socio-political environments of increasing violence, poverty, and inequality.",

      "abstract": "This study uses a spatial bio-economic modelling framework to estimate the impact of the 2012 weather extreme in the USA on food security in the developing world. The study also quantifies the potential effects of a similar weather extreme occurring in 2050 under climate change. The study results indicate that weather extremes that affect maize productivity in key grain baskets can negatively affect food security in vulnerable countries. The 2012 weather extreme which occurred in the USA reduced US and global maize production by 29% compared to trend; maize consumption in the country decreased by 5% only and this resulted in less surplus maize for exports from the largest maize exporter in the world. Global maize production decreased by 6% compared to trend. The decrease in global maize production coupled with a reduction in the volume of global maize exports worsened food insecurity in eastern Africa, the Caribbean and Central America and India. The effects of the weather extreme on global food security would be worse, if the latter were to occur under climate change in 2050, assuming no climate change adaptation worldwide over the years. In addition, the hardest-hit regions would remain the same, whether the weather extreme occurs in 2012 instead of 2050: Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), South Asia and the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region. However, sustained growth in per capita income across world economies between 2000 and 2050 would allow few countries in SSA and the LAC region to virtually eliminate hunger within their borders. In these countries, per capita income would be high enough by 2050 to completely offset the negative effect of the weather extreme. The study results are also consistent with USDA׳s estimates on US and global maize production and consumption in 2012 after the weather extreme. Some discrepancy is found on the volume of global maize trade; this implies that the bio-economic model likely overestimates the effect of the weather extreme on food insecurity. However, the trends from the analysis are likely to be valid. Further research would involve using a CGE model that can capture the net effects of weather extremes.",

      "abstract": "This chapter reviews the available paleoecological information on Pantepui since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in order to reconstruct the ecological dynamics that have led to the present configuration of plant communities and to unravel the potential environmental drivers involved, with emphasis on regional climate changes and fire. To date-parts, no LGM sediments have been retrieved atop the tepuis, so the vegetation of these summits during the last glaciation remains unknown. Some lowland records suggest that cold LGM climates favored downward migration of temperature-sensitive tepuian species, which drove changes in the taxonomic composition of lowland forests. The available paleoecological record of Pantepui ranges from the early Holocene to the present. These records show two contrasting situations. Some tepui summits exhibit a long vegetation constancy extending back to the mid-Holocene, whereas others document significant changes in sensitive species that have been associated with regional climatic events, such as the Holocene Thermal Maximum, the latitudinal migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, the El Niño Southern Oscillation variability, or recent climatic shifts such as the Medieval Climatic Anomaly or the Little Ice Age. This has been interpreted in terms of the site’s sensitivity, and it has been recommended to obtain past records, preferably on elevational ecotones, where vertical migrations of species are more easily detected. During the last millennium, fire, most probably of anthropogenic origin and likely originating on the surrounding uplands, has been a major driver of vegetation change on some tepuis.",

      "abstract": "The term “wilderness” has several dimensions. It is used as a biological descriptor for intact or largely intact areas that have little or no industrial infrastructure and are remote from urban areas. It is also used as a protected area classification for areas corresponding to Category 1b—wilderness areas in IUCN's protected areas classification system. And finally, the term “wilderness” captures human relationships with wild places—from Indigenous Peoples who view wilderness not as a thing apart but as “home” to sacred natural sites to areas where urban populations recreate. Crucially, wilderness areas are not places where people are excluded, but rather places where certain human activities are restricted or not allowed. Wilderness areas around the world are shrinking quickly and are increasingly rare, and conservation of Earth's remaining wilderness is urgently needed: they are indispensable for biodiversity conservation, for climate change mitigation and adaptation, for freshwater quality—and many other ecosystem services—and for the protection of cultural integrity and biocultural landscapes as well as livelihoods.",

      "abstract": "Climate change models predict sea level rise and increased intensity of storms and hurricanes in tropical sea turtle nesting areas. These factors could significantly increase beach inundation and erosion, thus affecting water content of sea turtle nesting beaches. Here, we conducted a field and laboratory study of how sand water content is related to embryonic development and hatching success of leatherback turtle nests. Moreover, we have experimentally incubated eggs of this species in beach sand under standardized conditions, but at different realistic levels of sand water content, varying from 1% to 12%. On the beaches, females nested from the intertidal zone to the lower part of the sand vegetation dunes, where nests were exposed to a wide range of sand water contents that ranged from 0.8% to 22%. However, both field and experimental studies revealed a strong negative correlation between sand water content and emergence success (field study: r=−0.73, P<0.0001; experiment: r=−0.84, P<0.0001). In the field, mean emergence success varied from 0% for the wettest nests to 64% for the driest ones. Nests in wet sand suffered higher mortality, primarily in the earlier developmental stages. Eggs incubated in the driest sand lost mass, but there were no significant effects on hatchling mass or run speed compared to eggs that gained water during incubation. However, hatchling straight carapace length (SCL) was greater in eggs from the driest treatment. The results of the present study inform management of change under future climate change sea level rise scenarios, suggesting that leatherback turtle nesting success should be expected to decrease.",

      "abstract": "The efficiency of carbon (C) sequestration and its long-term storage by the mangroves and other shallow coastal habitats (like seagrass, tidal marsh, macroalgae) has been well recognized in mitigating climate change. Sediment is the largest reservoir of this sequestered C, also known as “blue C.” Blue C can be exported from sediment to the coastal water as dissolved or particulate form, or degraded to CO2 and release in the atmosphere, or it can be buried within the sediment for centuries to millennia. Other than discussing sedimentary C exchange processes in mangroves, we also reviewed current global database of blue C and identified South Asian countries as poor inventory despite a significant coverage (6.5%) and presence of world's largest deltaic mangrove, the Sundarbans (~10,000km2). From data synthesis, blue C stock in South Asian mangroves is overall low compared to the neighboring South East (SE) Asian mangroves, that is due to less C% in sediment, low forest productivity, and nutrient limitation in the sediment. Application of stable isotopes, molecular biomarkers have been discussed to delineate sources of organic carbon (OC) in the sediment. Potential algal sources are recognized to contribute to sedimentary OC in southeastern India and Bangladesh mangroves, that could also explain their low C%, contrast to C-rich SE Asian mangroves where OC is largely of terrigenous origin. In the present discussion, C budget for the Indian Sundarbans has been revisited, that still warrants further investigations on biogeochemical sink processes (some aspects like benthic faunal production, fine root production, lithogenous or biogenous carbonate production, night-time benthic respiration). Lastly, we discussed on various aspects of blue C research to be undertaken in these mangrove ecosystems in future to fill the current gaps and challenges to develop better policies and how blue C research would help in conserving South Asian mangroves.",

      "abstract": "The colonization of the epiphytic niche of Neotropical forest canopies played an important role in orchid’s extraordinary diversification, with rare reversions to the terrestrial habit. To understand the evolutionary context of those reversals, we investigated the diversification of Galeandra, a Neotropical orchid genus which includes epiphytic and terrestrial species. We hypothesized that reversion to the terrestrial habit accompanied the expansion of savannas. To test this hypothesis we generated a comprehensive time-calibrated phylogeny and employed comparative methods. We found that Galeandra originated towards the end of the Miocene in Amazonia. The terrestrial clade originated synchronously with the rise of dry vegetation biomes in the last 5 million years, suggesting that aridification dramatically impacted plant diversification and habits in the Neotropics. Shifts in habit impacted floral spur lengths and geographic range size, but not climatic niche. The longer spurs and narrower ranges characterize epiphytic species, which probably adapted to specialized long-tongued Euglossini bee pollinators inhabiting forested habits. The terrestrial species present variable floral spurs and wider distribution ranges, with evidence of self-pollination, suggesting the loss of specialized pollination system and concomitant range expansion. Our study highlights how climate change impacted habit evolution and associated traits such as mutualistic interactions with pollinators.",

Pantepui aquatic insect fauna is composed of genera that are confined to the nutrient-poor waters of the Guiana Shield together with other widespread genera. The unsuitable habitat among tepuis represents an ecological barrier, which limits faunal interchange among tepuis through adjacent lowlands and uplands. Limited dispersal among tepui summits and habitat shifts from summits to adjacent savannas or vice versa, followed by long-term isolation, have played important roles in species diversification. Therefore a single-tepui endemism is a common phenomenon, although the occurrence of the same species on multiple tepuis has also been recorded. A systematic study of Pantepui aquatic insect taxonomy, distribution, and ecology, as well as the structure of aquatic communities and their ecosystems’ functioning, are necessary in order to elucidate-parts the evolutionary and ecological processes that have formed its aquatic communities.",

      "abstract": "Modeling soil water availability for tropical trees is a prerequisite to predicting the future impact of climate change on tropical forests. In this paper we develop a discrete-time deterministic water balance model adapted to tropical rainforest climates, and we validate-parts it on a large dataset that includes micro-meteorological and soil parameters along a topographic gradient in a lowland forest of French Guiana. The model computes daily water fluxes (rainfall interception, drainage, tree transpiration and soil plus understorey evapotranspiration) and soil water content using three input variables: daily precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and solar radiation. A novel statistical approach is employed that uses Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) soil moisture data to estimate water content at permanent wilting point and at field capacity, and root distribution. Inaccuracy of the TDR probes and other sources of uncertainty are taken into account by model calibration through a Bayesian framework. Model daily output includes relative extractable water, REW, i.e. the daily available water standardized by potential available water. The model succeeds in capturing temporal variations in REW regardless of topographic context. The low Root Mean Square Error of Predictions suggests that the model captures the most important drivers of soil water dynamics, i.e. water refilling and root water extraction. Our model thus provides a useful tool to explore the response of tropical forests to climate scenarios of changing rainfall regime and intensity.",

      "abstract": "There is increasing concern, to what extent production forests in the Neotropics are sustainably managed. The implementation of effective forest management strategies that are ecologically beneficial plays thus a central role to prevent forest degradation. However, to identify effective forest management strategies, there is a need for methods supporting the decision-making process. The main objective of our study is to analyze the mid- and long-term impacts of different management intensities, such as varying the minimum stem diameter of harvestable commercial trees, on the dynamic and structure of a species-rich tropical lowland forest of French Guiana. Therefore, we have applied the management module of a dynamic forest model and analyzed simulation experiments for undisturbed forest growth and selective logging. For the first time we were able to quantify the mean recovery times of multiple ecosystem functions and properties (biomass, gross primary production, leaf area index, Shanon diversity, timber volume) after selective logging. Accordingly, we validate-partsd simulation results (biomass, number of trees harvested) of selective logging with forest inventory data from the last 32 years. The forest model reliably reproduces the observed pre-logging biomass, tree-size distribution, and logging intensity (10 trees/ha, 39 m3/ha). In addition, it became clear how strongly management with higher logging intensities influences the forest in the long term: (1) the mean recovery times of the investigated ecosystem functions were significantly extended. With very intensive logging (116 m3/ha), the average recovery time of forest biomass was almost twice as long as in a moderate simulation scenario (tint 138 a, tmod 77 a). Similar patterns were observed for other ecosystem functions, e.g. timber volume (tint 158 a, tmod 62 a). (2) Additionally, the functional composition shifted, as up to 30% pioneer tree species in particular invaded the forest. This innovative use of forest growth models may help in the development of ecologically reasonable forest management strategies.",

Stand structure and species diversity were assessed in 27 sample plots (20 m× 20 m) covering 1.08 ha of forest. A total of 11 species were recorded. Out of them, 7, 6, and 9 species were found in fresh water, moderate, and strong saline zone, respectively. Species dominance in terms of importance value showed Heritiera fomes > Excoecaria agallocha > Bruguiera sexangula > Xylocarpus mekongensis in fresh water zone; H. fomes > E. agallocha > Avicennia officinalis > Ceriops decandra in moderate saline zone. E. agallocha > Sonneratia apetala > H. fomes > C. decandra in strong saline zone. Species diversity decreased from fresh water to strong saline zone. The findings showed a wide range of leaf morphological plasticity of all the parameters within and among saline zones. Leaf index, plasticity index, and specific leaf area were maximum in fresh water zone than of others. The findings of PCA revealed clear evidences of plastic behavior of leaf morphological parameters. Thus, the plasticity of leaf morphology might contribute as an influential biological signs of forthcoming climate change events.",

      "abstract": "This paper undertakes an exploration of the potential application of the Weitzman prioritisation approach to the conservation of plant genetic resources (PGR). Using a case study approach and assuming limited conservation resources, this approach is applied to calculate the maximum diversity which can be conserved based on a clustering of cacao species (Theobroma cacao L.). A conservation budget allocation model applied across a set of ten clusters and nine subclusters of cacao, together with the use of alternative diversity and risk measures, allowed for an evaluation of a range of potential conservation outcomes. Alternative risk measures generally resulted in the allocation of conservation funds to the same priority clusters of cacao (Criollo and Curaray). However, the use of the number of locally common alleles as an alternative to the original Weitzman diversity measure produced a markedly different result, prioritising the Purús cluster in Western Amazonia. The Curaray cluster was highly prioritised under both diversity measures, indicating its distinctiveness relative to both the Criollo and Purús clusters. We conclude that the Weitzman approach can indeed allow diversity comparisons to be made between the outcomes of different PGR conservation strategies, although subjective decisions regarding the choice of diversity and risk measures remain.",

In spite of the availability of such information, largely as grey literature, there is limited evidence as to the extent it is being used in fisheries management in Trinidad and Tobago. The flow of information between multiple stakeholders − fishing industry, scientists, fisheries managers, policy makers, and fisheries advisory bodies − was studied based on responses to a survey of key individuals to document each of their roles in the creation, distribution, and use of fisheries information. Content analysis of responses was completed to determine the opportunities and barriers for using scientific information in fisheries management. Salience, credibility, and legitimacy of the information were shadowed by barriers that decreased these attributes. Knowledge about the fishery has increased and technical capabilities have been strengthened through research. At the same time, advances in digital technology have made information more accessible. Yet, the high technical content of fisheries information reduced its usefulness to some stakeholders and formal systems do not exist for distributing or measuring the use and influence of such information in decision making. Communication strategies to promote awareness of the scientific information and aligning scientific information with fisheries policy could increase its use and influence. Institutional support for partnerships and education to encourage stakeholder involvement could also facilitate increased influence of scientific information.",

Freshwater ecosystems are impacted by many stressors with impacts that remain poorly understood. While we know the status and the effects of some stressors on certain fish and invertebrate species, whole ecosystem effects are yet to be understood. We describe the status and general trends of 10 stressors: variation in rainfall due to climate change; changes in forest cover (e.g., logging, deforestation, and afforestation); agriculture and livestock; impervious cover (e.g., urban areas); mining operations; flow regulation; loss of riparian zones and floodplains; overfishing; and the introduction of exotic species. Agriculture, mining, and increase in impervious cover due to urbanization are the major stressors for neotropical freshwater ecosystems. Although information is limited the local extinctions of freshwater populations and the loss of ecosystem functions and services are common and likely to increase given the limited conservation measures applied in the region.",

      "abstract": "The Demerara Plateau, off the French Guiana and Surinam margin, corresponds to a prominent sub-horizontal marginal plateau. The interpretation of a large set of seismic data acquired along the Demerara Plateau and integration with previous seismic stratigraphy and drill studies enables a better understanding of the sedimentary evolution of the outer Demerara marginal plateau. Since the end of the transform activity (late Albian), three sedimentary evolutionary stages have been identified. 1) The Pre-contourite Stage (late Albian to early Miocene) is strongly controlled by the structure of the margin that influences the distribution pattern of post-transform deposits through differential thermal subsidence between transform and divergent segments. 2) The Transitional Stage (middle Miocene to early Pliocene) is expressed as a current-controlled erosive surface resulting from the onset of bottom-current interactions due to the establishment and strengthening of the modern thermohaline circulation that is coeval with the progressive closure of the Isthmus of Panama. 3) The Contourite Stage (middle Pliocene to Holocene) is characterized by the development of a contourite depositional system that is linked to the activity of the North Atlantic Deep Water circulation and by a complex interaction between alongslope and downslope processes. Our study highlights that marginal plateaus might be particularly prone to develop contourite features since they regionally influence ocean current dynamics in guiding and accelerating bottom contour currents. Marginal plateaus should thus be considered as a key target to study bottom current dynamics and paleocirculation patterns.",

      "abstract": "This chapter presents changes in relative sea level (RSL) along tropical coastlines (30°N–30°S). Under current and future global changes, 90% of the coastlines are at risk, facing challenges of rising sea level (SL). Since the last century, scientists have attempted to understand processes governing RSL, to separate variations in absolute SL from those due to vertical land movement, and to discover their links to climate change. Recently developed space technologies provide accurate estimates of ongoing SL changes. Combined with tide gauge records, these new instruments (global positioning system, altimetry, interferometric synthetic aperture radar) offer a new perspective for the science associated with SL and its changes. This chapter reviews the concept of RSL, of RSL hotspots, and describes different RSL measurements. Then, it identifies and maps the hotspots of RSL changes and update-partss, where possible, previously published estimates of RSL trends. Identification of the RSL hotspots is of paramount importance for climate change mitigation and adaptation in tropical regions.",

      "abstract": "The inclusion of managed tropical forests in climate change mitigation has made it important to find the sustainable sweet-spot for timber production, carbon retention, and the quick recovery of both. Here we focus on recovery of aboveground carbon and timber stocks over the first 32years after selective logging with the CELOS Harvest System in Suriname. Our data are from twelve 1-ha permanent sample plots in which growth, survival, and recruitment of trees ≥15cm diameter were monitored between 1978 and 2012. We evaluate plot-level changes in basal area, stem density, aboveground carbon, and timber stock in response to average timber harvests of 15, 23, and 46m3ha−1. We use a linear mixed-effects model in a Bayesian framework to quantify recovery time for aboveground carbon and timber stock, as well as annualized increments for both. Our statistical models accounted for the uncertainty associated with the height and biomass allometries used to estimate aboveground carbon and increased precision of annualized aboveground carbon increments by including data from forty-one plots located elsewhere on the Guiana Shield. The probabilities of aboveground carbon recovery to pre-logging levels 32years after harvests of 15, 23 and 46m3ha−1 were 45%, 40%, and 24%, respectively. Net aboveground carbon increment for logged forests across all harvest intensities was 0.64MgCha−1yr−1, more than twice the rate observed in unlogged forests (0.26MgCha−1yr−1). The probabilities of timber stock recovery at the end of the 32-year period were highest after harvest intensities of 15 and 23m3ha−1 (with 80% probability) and lowest after the harvest of 46m3ha−1 (with 70% probability). Timber stock recovery across all harvest intensities was driven primarily by residual tree growth. Application of the legal cutting limit of 25m3ha−1 will require more than 70 and 40years to recover aboveground carbon and timber stocks, respectively, with 90% probability. Based on the low recruitment rates of the twelve species harvested, the 25year cutting cycle currently implemented in Suriname is too short for long-term timber stock sustainability. We highlight the value of propagating uncertainty from individual tree measurements to statistical predictions of carbon stock recovery. Ultimately, our study reveals the trade-offs that must be made between timber and carbon services as well as the opportunity to use carbon payments to enable longer cutting rotations to capture carbon from forest regrowth.",

      "abstract": "We predict stand basal area (BA) from small footprint LiDAR data in 129 one-ha tropical forest plots across four sites in French Guiana and encompassing a great diversity of forest structures resulting from natural (soil and geological substrate) and anthropogenic effects (unlogged and logged forests). We use predictors extracted from the Canopy Height Model to compare models of varying complexity: single or multiple regressions and nested models that predict BA by independent estimates of stem density and quadratic mean diameter. Direct multiple regression was the most accurate, giving a 9.6% Root Mean Squared Error of Prediction (RMSEP). The magnitude of the various errors introduced during the data collection stage is evaluated and their contribution to MSEP is analyzed. It was found that these errors accounted for less than 10% of model MSEP, suggesting that there is considerable scope for model improvement. Although site-specific models showed lower MSEP than global models, stratification by site may not be the optimal solution. The key to future improvement would appear to lie in a stratification that captures variations in relations between LiDAR and forest structure.",

      "abstract": "Conservation-related concerns about Pantepui usually pertain to direct human impacts (biopiracy, invader species, fire, contamination, etc.), and little attention has been paid to indirect threats, such as global warming (GW). This chapter summarizes the studies carried out to date-parts aimed at estimating the potential impact of the projected GW by the end of this century on the Pantepui biota, particularly on vascular plants. The main threat seems to be extinction caused by habitat loss due to the impossibility of upward migration on the flat summits of the tepuis. Potential extinction has been estimated on the basis of GW predictions from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) using the altitudinal range shift (ARS) and species–area relationship (SAR) methods. The preliminary results suggest the potential extinction of up to approximately 80% of the vascular flora, including approximately 50% of the Pantepui–endemic species. Several in situ and ex situ protection measures are discussed in an attempt to palliate such eventual biodiversity depletion. The available extinction estimates are preliminary and based on homogeneous responses of all vascular plants to GW, which is not fully realistic but is all that can be done with the available information. Future studies should be aimed at refining extinction estimates, considering the eventual idiosyncratic responses of the different species, such as differential migration rates, phenotypic plasticity, or adaptive ability. However, the main handicap is the lack of autoecological information on Pantepui species and the unfeasibility of conducting such studies due to the bureaucratic impediments related to obtaining sampling permits. It is urgent to circumvent this situation if the biodiversity of Pantepui, one of the very few pristine locations left on our planet, is to be preserved.",

      "abstract": "During the past few decades, commercial silvopastoral systems (SPS) with exotic Eucalyptus (hybrid) trees have become popular in the Brazilian Cerrado (savanna). With the increasing awareness about the role of carbon (C) storage in soils as a climate-change mitigation strategy and the relationship between the nature of soil aggregates and the soil's carbon sequestration potential, it is important to understand the influence of such SPS systems on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage. We studied C content in three aggregate size classes in six land-use systems on Oxisols in Minas Gerais, Brazil. The systems were planted forest, native secondary forest, managed pasture, and three 8-year-old SPS, differing in their tree-planting configurations. Eucalyptus hybrid was the tree in SPS and planted forest treatments, and Urochloa decumbens was the grass in SPS and pasture treatments. From each treatment, replicated soil samples were collected from four depth-classes (0–10, 10–30, 30–60, and 60–100 cm), fractionated by wet sieving into the three aggregate-size classes, 2000 to 250 μm, 250 to 53 μm, and <53 μm size classes representing macroaggregates, microaggregates, and silt + clay, respectively, and their C contents determined. Down to 1 m, total SOC stock values ranged from 260 Mg ha−1 under pasture to 167 Mg ha−1 under native forest, with 174 Mg ha−1 for Eucalyptus plantation and about 195 Mg ha−1 for the three SPS. Compared to the degraded native forest, the pasture system had significantly higher SOC in the whole soil and the aggregate size fractions, especially in the lower soil-depth classes. The lower SOC stock of Eucalyptus hybrid SPS compared to open pasture differs from the general trend of SPS having higher stock. Given that the Cerrado biome is a biodiversity hotspot, the use of native nitrogen-fixing trees, of which there are several, is worth investigating. In addition, the conversion from Eucalyptus monocultures to SPS could be considered as a strategy to increase the SOC stock.",

      "abstract": "Decreasing growth rate (Feeley et al., 2007) and large die-back due to drought (Phillips et al., 2009) suggest that tropical forests are suffering recent climate changes. Forest vulnerability to external factors (e.g. air pollution, acid rain) is widely studied in northern countries, while only a few attempts have investigated crown integrity in the Tropics. The method needs to be generic enough to account for the large number of species and crown shapes encountered in tropical forests. In the present study, we developed and tested a novel field method that estimates crown fragmentation (main branch mortality (MB) and secondary branch mortality (SB)), liana infestation (LI) and crown position (CP) in the canopy. The relationship between crown fragmentation and annual growth rate (agr) was investigated through multiple regression. Six out of eight canopy tree species showed significant growth decline with increasing crown fragmentation. Higher probability of death was also found in trees with severe crown fragmentation. The capacity of such crown assessment to depict tree vitality in a forest stand is discussed along with potential applications in both forest science and management.",

      "abstract": "The Paris Agreement has set a goal to limit the global average temperature rise to within 2°C from the pre-industrial level. This study aims to explore the possible pathways to achieve this challenging goal by using the Global Energy and Environmental Policy Analysis module (GEEPA) of the China's Climate Change Integrated Assessment Model (C3IAM). Results show that a target temperature of 2°C dramatically reduces global CO2 emissions in the future. Under model parameters, by the end of this century, total global CO2 emissions will fall below 5 Gt, and cumulated CO2 emissions will be reduced to less than 1000 Gt. The key to meeting the 2°C target lies in the low-carbon transformation of energy and electricity systems. Implementation of climate policies and technical measures will progressively reduce conventional fossil energy consumption and replace it with low-carbon energy solutions. The electricity structure will gradually shift from dominance by conventional fossil energy to low-carbon energy, and even to zero-carbon electricity generation. We found that emission reduction pathways that include large amounts of fossil fuel power generation with CCS merely relying on subsidies may create higher GDP loss, but also that later penetration of negative emission technology can increase the carbon emission budget in the early stage.",

      "abstract": "Presence of a coastal savanna belt expanding from British Guiana to northeastern Brazil cannot be explained by present-day climate. Using pollen and charcoal analyses on an 11.6 k old sediment core from a coastal depression in the savanna belt near the mouth of the Amazon River we investigated the paleoenvironmental history to shed light on this question. Results indicate that small areas of savanna accompanied by a forest type composed primarily by the genus Micropholis (Sapotaceae) that has no modern analog existed at the beginning of the Holocene. After 11,200 cal yr BP, savanna accompanied by few trees replaced the forest. In depressions swamp forest developed and by ca 10,000 cal yr BP replaced by Mauritia swamps. Between 8500 and 5600 cal yr BP gallery forest (composed mainly of Euphorbiaceae) and swamp forest succeeded the treeless savanna. The modern vegetation with alternating gallery forest and savanna developed after 5600 cal yr BP. We suggest that the early Holocene no-analog forest is a relict of previously more extensive forest under cooler and moister Lateglacial conditions. The early Holocene savanna expansion indicates a drier phase probably related to the shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) towards its northernmost position. The mid-Holocene forest expansion is probably a result of the combined influence of equatorwards shift of ITCZ joining the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ). The ecosystem variability during the last 5600 cal yr BP, formed perhaps under influence of intensified ENSO condition. High charcoal concentrations, especially during the early Holocene, indicate that natural and/or anthropogenic fires may have maintained the savanna. However, our results propose that climate change is the main driving factor for the formation of the coastal savanna in this region. Our results also show that the early Holocene sea level rise established mangroves near the study site until 7500 cal yr BP and promoted swamp formation in depressions, but did not influence the savanna vegetation.",

      "abstract": "Mangrove forests grow in coastal saline environments and, little is known about the stand water use (S) and regulation mechanisms of mangrove forests, particularly in the eastern mangrove group. We measured the xylem sap flow density (SFD) of six tree species for two years in a tropical mangrove forest on Hainan Island, China, which is under a monsoon climate. Bimodal daily SFD patterns were observed in all six species in spring and summer. The sap flow of all species were suppressed in winter strongly and also in spring. The annual water use per tree was positively correlated with diameter at breast height (DBH) (R2 = 0.81–0.89, P < 0.05). By scaling up from individual trees, we found that the S values of two mangrove plots ranged from 269.19 to 357.27 mm y−1 between the two study years, accounting for 18–22% of the annual rainfall. These S values are similar to those of other mangrove and tropical forests with similar stand basal areas. The crown conductance sensitivity (mc) to ln VPD (vapor pressure deficit) was strongly correlated with reference crown conductance (GCref) at 1 kPa VPD across all species. The slope value between mc and GCref divided the six species into two groups, suggesting Bruguiera sexangula, Rhizophora apiculata and Sonneratia alba were isohydric, Excoecaria agallocha, B. s. var. rhymchopetala and Xylocarpus granatum were anisohydric. The results of this study will be useful for modeling ecosystem services of mangrove ecosystems facing climate change.",

      "abstract": "Earth system models (ESMs) have been widely used to simulate global terrestrial carbon fluxes, including gross primary production (GPP) and net primary production (NPP). Assessment of such GPP and NPP products can be valuable for understanding the efficacy of certain ESMs in simulating the global carbon cycle and future climate impacts. In this work, we studied the model performance of 22 ESMs participating in the fifth and sixth phases of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5 and CMIP6) by comparing historical GPP and NPP simulations with satellite data from MODIS and further evaluating potential model improvement from CMIP5 to CMIP6. In CMIP6, the average global total GPP and NPP estimated by the 22 ESMs are 16% and 13% higher than MODIS data, respectively. The multi-model ensembles (MME) of the 22 ESMs can fairly reproduce the spatial distribution, zonal distribution and seasonal variations of both GPP and NPP from MODIS. They perform much better in simulating GPP and NPP for grasslands, wetlands, croplands and other biomes than forests. However, there are noticeable differences among individual ESM simulations in terms of overall fluxes, temporal and spatial flux distributions, and fluxes by biome and region. The MME consistently outperforms all individual models in nearly every respect. Even though several ESMs have been improved in CMIP6 relative to CMIP5, there is still much work to be done to improve individual ESM and overall CMIP performance. Future work needs to focus on more comprehensive model mechanisms and parametrizations, higher resolution and more reasonable coupling of land surface schemes and atmospheric/oceanic schemes.",

      "abstract": "Plant oil is a key commodity in the global economy, particularly for food and bioenergy markets. However, current production practices often impair smallholder livelihoods, cause land use changes, and compete for food production. The neotropical palm Acrocomia aculeata is currently being promoted as a novel sustainable biomass feedstock, particularly for bioenergy, but only little is known about the palm’s ecological requirements. Based on a comprehensive literature and database search for recorded occurrences of A. aculeata in Latin America, we computed an ecological niche modeling to determine the palm’s potential distribution area based on climatic and soil variables. We subsequently considered current land cover and predicted future climate change scenarios to discuss the cultivation potential of A. aculeata within its possible distribution area. The results revealed a large potential to cultivate A. aculeata in Latin America under current abiotic environmental conditions. The two core distribution regions identified were (1) Central America including the Caribbean, northern Colombia and Venezuela, and (2) southern Brazil and eastern Paraguay. A considerable proportion of the medium to highly suitable growing areas were found to be currently used for agricultural production or covered by land types with high conservation and carbon sequestration value. Applying the model under the IPCC’s A2A ‘business as usual’ emission scenario suggested that by 2080 the vast majority of suitable growing areas severely decline in extent or disappear entirely. Our ecological niche modeling thus shows that despite the palm’s high cultivation potential, a sustainable deployment of A. aculeata requires a precautious, evidence-based approach.",

      "abstract": "Global temperatures have increased at a historically unprecedented pace. This paper finds that the negative effect of temperature on output in countries with hot climates runs through reduced investment, depressed labor productivity, poorer human health, and lower agricultural and industrial output. We find that hot low-income countries suffer the largest costs. In a median low-income country, aggregate output is about 2 percent lower and investment is about 10 percent lower seven years after a 1 degree increase in average annual temperature. We also find that economic development, in general, helps to shield countries from temperature shocks, with hot regions in high-income countries on average sustaining less economic damage from rising temperatures than hot regions in low-income countries.",

      "abstract": "Globally, mangroves sequester a large amount of carbon into the sediments, although spatial heterogeneity exists owing to a wide variety of local, regional, and global controls. Rapid environmental and climate change, including increasing sea-level rise, global warming, reduced upstream discharge and anthropogenic activities, are predicted to increase salinity in the mangroves, especially in the Bangladesh Sundarbans, thereby disrupting this blue carbon reservoir. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how salinity affects the belowground soil carbon despite the recognised effect on above ground productivity. To address this gap, research was undertaken in the Bangladesh Sundarbans to compare total soil organic carbon (SOC) across three salinity zones and to explore any potential predictive relationships with other physical, chemical properties and vegetation characteristics. Total SOC was significantly higher in the oligohaline zone (74.8 ± 14.9 Mg ha−1), followed by the mesohaline (59.3 ± 15.8 Mg ha−1), and polyhaline zone (48.3 ± 10.3 Mg ha−1) (ANOVA, F2, 500 = 118.9, p < 0.001). At all sites, the topmost 10 cm of soil contained higher SOC density than the bottom depths (ANOVA, F3, 500 = 30.1, p < 0.001). On average, Bruguiera sp. stand holds the maximum SOC measured, followed by two pioneer species Sonneratia apetala and Avicennia sp. Multiple regression results indicated that soil salinity, organic C:N and tree diameter were the best predictor for the variability of the SOC in the Sundarbans (R2 = 0.62). Despite lower carbon in the soil, the study highlights that the conservation priorities and low deforestation rate have led to less CO2 emissions than most sediment carbon-rich mangroves in the world. The study also emphasised the importance of spatial conservation planning to safeguard the soil carbon-rich zones in the Bangladesh Sundarbans from anthropogenic tourism and development activities to support climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.",

      "abstract": "The western tropical Atlantic plays an important role in the interhemispheric redistribution of heat during millennial-scale changes in the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The proper evaluation of this role depends on a clear understanding of sea surface temperature (SST) variations during AMOC slowdown periods like Heinrich Stadials (HS) in the western tropical Atlantic. However, published SST records from the western tropical Atlantic between ca. 4°S and 7°N show inconsistencies that are apparently related to the employed temperature proxy (i.e., Mg/Ca versus alkenone unsaturation index U37k′). In general, while Mg/Ca values indicate warming during Heinrich Stadials, U37k′ values show cooling. To assess this issue, we sampled core GeoB16224-1 retrieved off French Guiana (i.e., 6°39.38′N) and reconstructed water temperatures at high resolution using Mg/Ca on the foraminifera species Globigerinoides ruber, U37k′, TEX86 and modern analogue technique (MAT) transfer functions using planktonic foraminifera assemblages calibrated for 50 m water depth. Our results show that Mg/Ca and TEX86 values recorded an increase in SST related to AMOC slowdown. Conversely, U37k′ and MAT values registered a decrease in temperatures during HS3 and HS1. Our U37k′ and Mg/Ca results thus confirm the previously reported inconsistency for the period between 48–13 cal ka BP. We suggest that several non-thermal physiological effects probably imparted a negative temperature bias on the U37k′ temperatures during Heinrich Stadials. However, MAT-based temperatures show similar variability with U37k′-based temperatures. Hence, we also suggest that during severe slowdown periods of the AMOC, a steeper meridional temperature gradient together with a southward shift of the Intertropical Convergent Zone produced not only an increase in SST but also a stronger upper water column stratification and a shoaling of the thermocline, decreasing subsurface temperatures. Our new high resolution temperature records allow a better characterization of the thermal response of the upper water column in the tropical western Atlantic to slowdown events of the AMOC, reconciling previously discrepant records.",

      "abstract": "The North Brazil Shelf is a Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) that extends from the Caribbean Sea, in Central America, to the Parnaiba River in Brazil, and includes six countries. The area is dominated by the runoff of large rivers, including the Amazon and Orinoco, and by the intense disturbance of sediment transport, tides and currents. The sea bed is formed mainly by mud in shallow water, and by sand, mud, and gravel in deeper water. In terms of its biological productivity, this LME can be considered oligotrophic, with stratified habitats. The main source of nutrients of the euphotic layer is the local rivers and mangroves. Primary production has been limited by light and rising temperatures in recent years, factors associated with a decrease in marine primary productivity. However, the benthic fauna is very rich and unique, but poorly known. More than 500 fish species have been recorded in this LME. Demersal fish and shrimp are the main fishery resources in coastal and continental shelf waters. Fisheries account for more than 600 million USD a year with a considerable diversity of methods and scales ranging from very small to industrial. Seafood consumption is moderate to high in the local countries. Climate changes, dam building, deforestation, pollution, overfishing, tourism and aquaculture are the main threats to ecosystem productivity and habitat quality. Socioeconomic data are scant for this LME. Development is concentrated near the cities and mouths of rivers. Traditional communities in the coastal areas are culturally diverse, but invariably characterized by very low socioeconomic conditions. The Gross Domestic Product of the local countries ranges from 7,500 USD per capita in Guyana to 32,600 USD per capita in Trinidad and Tobago. Profound problems of governability are common to all six countries, and mean governance indicators reflect poor performances in all cases. The main issues are an absence of effective rule of law, political stability, and control of corruption. Fisheries are characterized by increasing effort and an absence of sustainability. Most of the fishery stocks are either fully or over exploited. This scenario can only be rectified by investments in marine protected areas and scientific research, as well as the increased participation of fishers in the development and implementation of management strategies and regulations.",

      "abstract": "Global timber demands have penetrated vast tracts of tropical rainforest, with selective logging the most powerful driver of human disturbance within these ecosystems. We review the consequences of timber harvesting on rainforest ecosystems, from individual species through to biological communities. We also investigate the benefits that forest-dwelling communities and wider society can derive from well-managed production forests. Selectively logged forests maintain a wide array of ecosystem services, and orders of magnitude higher levels of biodiversity and carbon storage than the agricultural lands that often imperil them. To unlock the full potential of logged forests in conserving biodiversity, tackling climate change and delivering ecosystem services into the Anthropocene will require several major transitions. These include a pantropical shift towards more environmentally sensitive logging practises, the fostering of new norms in tropical forestry based around long-term forest management, as well as coordinated efforts to limit the negative effects of logging roads, illegal logging and climate change. We discuss potential incentive and enforcement-based mechanisms for precipitating such transitions and highlight key avenues for future enquiry. Research frontiers include determining how best to spatially design logging operations to limit environmental impacts, quantifying the costs and benefits of post-logging activities aimed at recovering logged forest values, and investigating the role of concession licence structures in spawning sustainable forest management. Given their spatial dominance and high conservation value, lofty planetary goals to limit climate change and global biodiversity declines cannot be achieved unless selectively logged tropical forests take a central role in emerging conservation and emissions-reducing agendas.",

The impact of climate change could increase the mortality of tropical forests and decrease their ability to store atmospheric carbon dioxide. Efforts to model the forest dynamics in these regions are hindered by the lack of ground measurements and the spatial-temporal overlap of function management processes. Some of the models developed attempt to show the environment’s influence on forest dynamics, particularly by studying the capacity for canopy deformation (plasticity of the crown), as explained in Purves et al. The models allow us to better understand the development of intertree competition, the capacity of species to adapt to changes and how the forest functions as a whole.",

      "abstract": "The interest in quantifying rare species has been increasing, but less attention has been paid to analysing their conservation status. Here, we used the Rabinowitz method based on geographical range, habitat specificity and population size to classify 2,203 tree species of South American savannas (SAS). We considered species with narrow (stenochoric) or wide (eurychoric) geographic range respectively occurring in up to 10% or over of the latitudinal belts in the SAS, specialist (stenoecious) or generalist (euryoecious) species occurring in one or more ecoregions, respectively, and locally scarce or abundant populations of species with low or high numbers of records within a grid cell of 1° latitude by 1° longitude, respectively. We then quantified species which only occur inside protected areas (PAs), in and outside PAs, or only outside PAs. Of the 2,203 species, 49.25% were rare, 40.35% stenochoric, 14.12% stenoecious and 56.15% had a scarce population. The Cerrado (433) followed by Caatinga (259), Campos Rupestres montane savanna (256), Bahia interior forests (189) and Guiana savanna (154) had the highest number of rare species. Only 6.44% species only occurred inside PAs, 83.79% in and outside PAs and 9.75% only outside PAs. Unprotected species are mostly geographically restricted with ecoregion specialists, and have small population sizes. The number of protected species are is positively correlated with the number of records within them. The establishment of PAs should focus on both core and disjunct savannas to encompass all ecoregions in order to ensure the conservation of species and the range of evolutionary processes in SAS.",

      "abstract": "Changes in the life cycle of organisms (i.e. phenology) are one of the most widely used early-warning indicators of climate change, yet this remains poorly understood throughout the tropics. We exhaustively reviewed any published and unpublished study on fruiting phenology carried out at the community level in the American tropics and subtropics (latitudinal range: 26°N–26°S) to (1) provide a comprehensive overview of the current status of fruiting phenology research throughout the Neotropics; (2) unravel the climatic factors that have been widely reported as drivers of fruiting phenology; and (3) provide a preliminary assessment of the potential phenological responses of plants under future climatic scenarios. Despite the large number of phenological datasets uncovered (218), our review shows that their geographic distribution is very uneven and insufficient for the large surface of the Neotropics (~1 dataset per ~78,000km2). Phenological research is concentrated in few areas with many studies (state of São Paulo, Brazil, and Costa Rica), whereas vast regions elsewhere are entirely unstudied. Sampling effort in fruiting phenology studies was generally low: the majority of datasets targeted fewer than 100 plant species (71%), lasted 2years or less (72%), and only 10.4% monitored >15 individuals per species. We uncovered only 10 sites with ten or more years of phenological monitoring. The ratio of numbers of species sampled to overall estimates of plant species richness was wholly insufficient for highly diverse vegetation types such as tropical rainforest, seasonal forest and cerrado, and only slightly more robust for less diverse vegetation types, such as deserts, arid shrublands and open grassy savannas. Most plausible drivers of phenology extracted from these datasets were environmental (78.5%), whereas biotic drivers were rare (6%). Among climatic factors, rainfall was explicitly included in 73.4% of cases, followed by air temperature (19.3%). Other environmental cues such as water level (6%), solar radiation or photoperiod (3.2%), and ENSO events (1.4%) were rarely addressed. In addition, drivers were analyzed statistically in only 38% of datasets and techniques were basically correlative, with only 4.8% of studies including any consideration of the inherently autocorrelated character of phenological time series. Fruiting peaks were significantly more often reported during the rainy season both in rainforests and cerrado woodlands, which is at odds with the relatively aseasonal character of the former vegetation type. Given that climatic models predict harsh future conditions for the tropics, we urgently need to determine the magnitude of changes in plant reproductive phenology and distinguish those from cyclical oscillations. Long-term monitoring and herbarium data are therefore key for detecting these trends. Our review shows that the unevenness in geographic distribution of studies, and diversity of sampling methods, vegetation types, and research motivation hinder the emergence of clear general phenological patterns and drivers for the Neotropics. We therefore call for prioritizing research in unexplored areas, and improving the quantitative component and statistical design of reproductive phenology studies to enhance our predictions of climate change impacts on tropical plants and animals.",

      "abstract": "Ecosystem changes can affect human health in several forms, most of them indirectly. Degraded ecosystems can affect water quality and availability, and cause a decrease in food production, climatic instability, poor protection against natural hazards (e.g., floods and storms), and loss of natural landscapes for aesthetic enjoyment. However, the most conspicuous and well-understood risks to health are those related to the infectious and parasitic diseases, especially those endemic in the tropical regions. The main driving forces responsible for ecosystem change today are the economic activities implemented to provide basic materials for livelihoods, such as a agriculture and animal husbandry, materials for construction (e.g., logging), and the provision of energy and water (e.g., dam building). Impacts of climate change also pose a new threat to ecosystems. These changes are taking place in a more rapid and intensive form in developing countries in the tropics.",

      "abstract": "Temperature increases can impact biodiversity and predicting their effects is one of the main challenges facing global climate-change research. Ectotherms are sensitive to temperature change and, although predictions indicate that tropical species are highly vulnerable to global warming, they remain one of the least studied groups with respect to the extent of physiological variation and local extinction risks. We model the extinction risks for a tropical heliothermic teiid lizard (Kentropyx calcarata) integrating previously obtained information on intraspecific phylogeographic structure, eco-physiological traits and contemporary species distributions in the Amazon rainforest and its ecotone to the Cerrado savannah. We also investigated how thermal-biology traits vary throughout the species' geographic range and the consequences of such variation for lineage vulnerability. We show substantial variation in thermal tolerance of individuals among thermally distinct sites. Thermal critical limits were highly correlated with operative environmental temperatures. Our physiological/climatic model predicted relative extinction risks for local populations within clades of K. calcarata for 2050 ranging between 26.1% and 70.8%, while for 2070, extinction risks ranged from 52.8% to 92.8%. Our results support the hypothesis that tropical-lizard taxa are at high risk of local extinction caused by increasing temperatures. However, the thermo-physiological differences found across the species' distribution suggest that local adaptation may allow persistence of this tropical ectotherm in global warming scenarios. These results will serve as basis to further research to investigate the strength of local adaptation to climate change. Persistence of Kentropyx calcarata also depends on forest preservation, but the Amazon rainforest is currently under high deforestation rates. We argue that higher conservation priority is necessary so the Amazon rainforest can fulfill its capacity to absorb the impacts of temperature increase on tropical ectotherms during climate change.",

Two simulation experiments are performed and indicate the success of the suggested method.

      "abstract": "Fire is used in the management of pastures, renewal and expansion of areas, and agricultural activities in South America (SA). The objectives of this study were: i) to identify the countries and regions with the highest number of fire foci in SA, and ii) to evaluate the spatial dynamics of fire foci based on the Meteorological Fire Danger Index (MFDI) and future scenarios through numerical simulations. Fire foci time series comprised 21 years (1998–2018) from the BDQueimadas database. Cluster Analysis (CA), descriptive and exploratory statistics were employed. Fire foci maps for SA were made in 10-km pixel dimensions. MFDI was used to assess fire danger via SPEEDY (Simplified Parametrizations, primitivE-Equation DYnamics) model simulations. Three simulations were performed: control scenario (1980–2015), RCP2.6 scenario (optimistic - 2016 and 2050), and RCP8.5 scenario (pessimistic - 2015 and 2050). Regionally, three homogeneous groups of fire foci (G1, G2 and G3) and one atypical (NA - Not Grouped) were identified for Brazil via CA. The highest fire foci occurred in Brazil (62.72%), followed by Bolivia (9.03%), Argentina (8.28%), Venezuela (6.11%), Paraguay (5.94%), and Colombia (3.87%), respectively. The highest density of fire foci occurred in the MATOPIBA region, the confluence of Maranhão, Tocantins, Piauí, and Bahia, - (agricultural frontier), and also in the Cerrado-Amazon transition and the states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul in Brazil, followed by Paraguay, Bolivia, Venezuela, and Argentina. The countries and regions of Brazil do not change, only intensify from year to year, and such fire foci variability may be associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases. The control scenario identified in east-central Brazil, western Bolivia, Paraguay, and northern Argentina. The optimistic scenario showed an improvement in some countries and a worsening in the territorial distribution in Brazil, Venezuela, and Colombia. The pessimistic scenario identified increased degradation compared to the previous scenarios in almost all SA countries.",

      "abstract": "The rainforests of the Neotropics shelter a vast diversity of plant, animal and microscopic species that provide critical ecosystem goods and services for both local and worldwide populations. These environments face a major crisis due to increased deforestation, pollution, and climate change, emphasizing the need for more effective conservation efforts. The adequate monitoring of these ecosystems has proven a complex and time consuming endeavour, which depends on ever dwindling taxonomic expertise. To date-parts, many species remain undiscovered, let alone described, with otherwise limited information regarding known species population distributions and densities. Overcoming these knowledge shortfalls and practical limitations is becoming increasingly possible through techniques based on environmental DNA (eDNA), i.e., DNA that can be obtained from environmental samples (e.g. tissues, soil, sediment, water, etc.). When coupled with high-throughput sequencing, these techniques now enable realistic, cost-effective, and standardisable biodiversity assessments. This opens up enormous opportunities for advancing our understanding of complex and species-rich tropical communities, but also in facilitating large-scale biomonitoring programs in the neotropics. In this review, we provide a brief introduction to eDNA methods, and an overview of their current and potential uses in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems of neotropical rainforests. We also discuss the limits and challenges of these methods for our understanding and monitoring of biodiversity, as well as future research and applied perspectives of these techniques in neotropical rainforests, and beyond.",

      "abstract": "Tropical forests harbor the greatest terrestrial biodiversity and provide various ecosystem services. The increase of human activities on these forests, among which logging, makes the conservation of biodiversity and associated services strongly dependent on the sustainability of these activities. However the indicators commonly used to assess the impact of forest exploitation, namely species richness and biomass, provide a limited understanding of their sustainability. Here, we assessed the sustainability of common forest exploitation in the Guiana Shield studying the recovery of two ecosystem services i.e. carbon storage and wood stock, and an ecosystem function i.e. seed dispersal by animals. Specifically, we compared total and commercial biomass, as well as functional composition in seed size of animal-dispersed species in replicated forest plots before and 27 years after exploitation. Species richness is also studied to allow comparison. While species richness was not affected by forest exploitation, total and commercial biomass as well as seed size of animal-dispersed species decreased 27 years after exploitation, similarly to forests affected by hunting. These results show that ecosystem services and function likely did not recover even at the lowest intensity of forest exploitation studied, questioning the sustainability of the most common rotation-cycle duration applied in the tropics.",

      "abstract": "Coastal wetlands have been proposed as highly threatened by the ongoing and future climatic change, including projected sea-level changes as an additional forcing factor compared to more inland locations. The limited knowledge generated to date-parts in this topic has been primarily focused on those areas attaining a high population density, and rarely deals with long-term (>50 years) dynamics. Here we present the first Holocene palaeoecological study carried in the Orinoco Delta, in NE Venezuela. The record presented here contains sediments from the last 6200 years and is located in a river-shore swamp dominated by the palm Mauritia flexuosa. Current human occupation is almost restricted to small settlements of the Warao indigenous culture, closely related to the use of M. flexuosa and other palm species present in the zone. The results show the occurrence of three well-distinguished palynological zones: (i) from 6200 to 5200 cal yr BP, characterised by mixed rainforest and other taxa related to salinity (coastal-like), low (negative) values of magnetic susceptibility and magnetic grain size, absence of transported clays, and the highest macrocharcoal particles abundance; (ii) from 5200 to 2950 cal yr BP, marked by a replacement of the mangrove-like vegetation by a more inland mixed-swamp forest community with low levels of charcoal, and (iii) from 2950 cal yr BP to present-day, characterised by the establishment of the current vegetation community, dominated by M. flexuosa, and an increasing trend in the charcoal curve since the last 700 years. A combination of regional (climatic changes) and local (sediment ontogeny) has been proposed as the key drivers influencing the vegetation succession recorded. The stabilisation of the sea-level that occurred during the mid-Holocene would have favoured the transgression of the coastal line, with the migration of the coastal-like vegetation seawards. Synchronous to this event, a trend towards drier conditions has been reported in the close Cariaco record, that could have also influenced the vegetation replacement. Between 3800 and 2800 years ago, the increased ENSO variability registered in Cariaco may have played a key role in the expansion of the Mauritia palm community. It is suggested that in our location, the potential inhabiting human populations were differently influenced by these environmental changes. First, the disappearance of the coastal resources could have favoured land abandonment, whereas the increase in the abundance of the palm might be influential for the arrival of other inland cultures that were previously used to manage Mauritia. This sequence shows the importance of the ecosystem services for the location inhabitants, highlighting the abandonment of the mid-Holocene culture coeval with the disappearance of its ecosystem. These results also provide information about the sensitivity and resilience in facing external stressors of both humans and vegetation, and will be valuable tools for managing the future of this ecosystem.",

Five themes are developed. First, tectonism and tectonic change are outlined in terms of changing tectonic concepts, plate mechanics, continental interiors (cratons, platform covers), and continental margins (passive, active). Second, climate forcing is reviewed by defining weather and climate, early notions of climate change, and probable causes of climate change. Climates change through time in response to several interactive forces: those external to Earth, those related to Earth's orbital relations with the Sun, and those internal to the Earth system among which tectonism profoundly alters the playing field for climate and geomorphic processes. Third, the spatial implications for geomorphology of changing tectonic and climate forcing are viewed in the context of latitude and location, continentality and oceanicity, ocean gateways and land corridors, continental elevation and relief barriers, and vegetation cover. Fourth, prefaced by a discussion of the nature and rate of change, the temporal implications for geomorphology of tectonic and climate change over the past 300 million years are evaluated. Eight topics are discussed: the Pangea supercontinent, opening of the Atlantic Ocean and Tethys, opening of the Southern Ocean, uplift of North America's Western Cordillera, uplift of the Andes, uplift of the Eurasian Cordillera and Tethys closure, closure of the Central American isthmus, and volcanism. Last, three geomorphic feedbacks that affect tectonism and climate are discussed: denudation, sedimentation, and isostasy; biogeochemical cycling; and relative sea-level change.",

      "abstract": "Deforestation and agrosystem establishment can alter soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, leading to greenhouse gases emissions and fertility losses, however SOC response has great variability. In the humid tropics like the Amazonia biome, carbon inputs from agrosystems are rarely quantified and described, despite their major contribution to the SOC dynamics after deforestation. We assessed SOC dynamics with repeated measurements in the layer 0–30cm until five years after deforestation in a diachronic site in French Guiana, cleared with a fire-free method associated to large woody debris inputs. Three agrosystems were studied: one year maize/soybean rotation with disk tillage (DT) and without tillage (NT), and a mowed grassland (G). Aboveground carbon inputs from agrosystems were measured. In addition to SOC stocks assessment, we measured roots carbon stocks, and performed δ13C measurements in grassland soil. We found a transient SOC stock increase until 1.5 years after deforestation because of large woody debris inputs from deforestation method, but these C inputs were rapidly mineralized and poorly contributed to SOC stocks 5 years after deforestation. SOC stocks in grassland did not differ from forest despite large hay exports. Thanks to large root-derived carbon inputs, C4-SOC stock in grassland was 10.4tha−1 5 years after deforestation (18.7% of the SOC stock). In annual crops, 5 years after deforestation, SOC stocks decreased on average by 18.6% compared to forest. SOC stocks did not differ according to soil tillage since aboveground carbon inputs were similar in DT and NT systems. Lower SOC stocks in annual crops compared to grassland is explained by lower carbon restitutions and by higher mineralization rate of organic matter.",

      "abstract": "In view of the unique biological characteristics of mangroves, it is interesting to assess the extent to which these ecosystems can be used as indicators of coastal change or sea-level rise. From recent studies of mangrove mortality at several locations (including Guiana, Gambia, Côte d'Ivoire, Kenya, India and Bangladesh), it appears that these coastal ecosystems are so specialized that any minor variation in their hydrological or tidal regimes causes noticeable mortality. Each species of mangrove (but particularly those belonging to the genera Rhizophora, Bruguiera, Sonneratia, Heritiera and Nypa) occurs in ecological conditions that approach its limit of tolerance with regard to salinity of the water and soil, as well as the inundation regime. If the duration of daily immersion were to be modified by tectonic, sedimentological or hydrological events, the species either readjusts to the new conditions or succumbs to unsuitable conditions. Consequently, the use of remote sensing data for mangrove ecosystems offers excellent potential as a tool for monitoring coastal change.",

      "abstract": "Tropical forests are affected by recent climate change, but detailed knowledge how forests in different regions of the tropics respond to changing climate conditions is not sufficiently studied. Our objectives were to evaluate climatic effects on the monthly cambial activity of Pinus latteri and Pinus kesiya and to determine the relationships between climatic variables (precipitation, temperature, and relative humidity) and the tree-ring widths of these two pine species. Cambial dynamics of P. latteri and P. kesiya in subtropical Thailand were studied for two consecutive growing seasons. We observed that monthly rainfall, relative humidity, soil moisture, monthly minimum temperature, and monthly mean temperature were positively related to the number of cambial cell layers and cambial zone width. Moisture in the late dry season and in the beginning of the rainy season was very important in stimulating cambial cell division after a long-term moisture deficit for more than three months. The growth responses to climate in a 128-year-long chronology of P. latteri and an 88-year-long chronology of P. kesiya were similar. Importantly, the amount of rainfall and relative humidity in April and May had positive effects on the tree-ring widths of both pine species. On the other hand, both mean monthly maximum temperature and mean monthly temperature had negative effects on tree-ring widths. P. kesiya is more susceptible to drought, as shown by its correlation with the self-calibrated Palmer drought severity index. The rising temperatures during the recent 30-year observation period clearly show that higher temperatures covered the northern and central regions of Thailand and are likely to reduce the productivity of both pine species.",

      "abstract": "Background\nThe four common soil-transmitted helminth species—Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and the two hookworm species Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus—are endemic in South America, but their distribution, infection prevalence, and regional burden are poorly understood. We aimed to estimate the risk and number of people infected with A lumbricoides, T trichiura, and hookworm across South America.\nMethods\nWe did a systematic review of reports on the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth infection in South America published up to May 14, 2012. We extracted and georeferenced relevant survey data and did a meta-analysis of the data to assess the geographical distribution of the infection risk with Bayesian geostatistical models. We used advanced Bayesian variable selection to identify environmental determinants that govern the distribution of soil-transmitted helminth infections.\nFindings\nWe screened 4085 scientific papers and identified 174 articles containing relevant survey prevalence data. We georeferenced 6948 survey locations and entered the data into the open-access Global Neglected Tropical Diseases database. Survey data were sparse for the south of the continent and for the western coast, and we identified no relevant information for Uruguay and little data for smaller countries such as Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana, and Ecuador. Population-adjusted prevalence of infection with A lumbricoides was 15·6%, with T trichiura was 12·5%, and with hookworm was 11·9% from 2005 onwards. Risks of contracting soil-transmitted helminth infection have substantially reduced since 2005 (odds ratio 0·47 [95% Bayesian credible interval 0·46–0·47] for A lumbricoides, 0·54 [0·54–0·55] for T trichiura, and 0·58 [0·58–0·59] for hookworm infection).\nInterpretation\nOur findings offer important baseline support for spatial targeting of soil-transmitted helminthiasis control, and suggest that more information about the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth infection is needed, especially in countries in which we estimate prevalence of infection to be high but for which current data are scarce.\nFunding\nUBS Optimus Foundation and Brazilian Swiss Joint Research Programme (BSJRP 011008).",

      "abstract": "Bats are ecologically important mammals in tropical ecosystems; however, their populations face numerous environmental threats related to climate change, habitat loss, fragmentation, hunting, and emerging diseases. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop and implement large-scale networks to monitor trends in bat populations over extended time periods. Using data from a range of Neotropical and Paleotropical bat assemblages, we assessed the ability for long-term monitoring programs to reliably detect temporal trends in species abundance. We explored the magnitude of within-site temporal variation in abundance and evaluated the statistical power of a suite of different sampling designs for several different bat species and ensembles. Despite pronounced temporal variation in abundance of most tropical bat species, power simulations suggest that long-term monitoring programs (⩾20years) can detect population trends of 5% per year or more with adequate statistical power (⩾0.9). However, shorter monitoring programs (⩽10years) have insufficient power for trend detection. Overall, our analyses demonstrate that a monitoring program extending over 20years with four surveys conducted biennially on five plots per monitoring site would have the potential for detecting a 5% annual change in abundance for a suite of bat species from different ensembles. The likelihood of reaching adequate statistical power was sensitive to initial species abundance and the magnitude of count variation, stressing that only the most abundant species in an assemblage and those with generally low variation in abundance should be considered for detailed population monitoring.",

      "abstract": "We investigate the redistribution of terrigenous materials in the northeastern (NE) South American continental margin during slowdown events of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The compilation of stratigraphic data from 108 marine sediment cores collected across the western tropical Atlantic shows an extreme rise in sedimentation rates off the Parnaíba River mouth (about 2°S) during Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1, 18–15 ka). Sediment core GeoB16206-1, raised offshore the Parnaíba River mouth, documents relatively constant 143Nd/144Nd values (expressed as εNd(0)) throughout the last 30 ka. Whereas the homogeneous εNd(0) data support the input of fluvial sediments by the Parnaíba River from the same source area directly onshore, the increases in Fe/Ca, Al/Si and Rb/Sr during HS1 indicate a marked intensification of fluvial erosion in the Parnaíba River drainage basin. In contrast, the εNd(0) values from sediment core GeoB16224-1 collected off French Guiana (about 7°N) suggest Amazon-sourced materials within the last 30 ka. We attribute the extremely high volume of terrigenous sediments deposited offshore the Parnaíba River mouth during HS1 to (i) an enhanced precipitation in the catchment region and (ii) a reduced North Brazil Current, which are both associated with a weakened AMOC.",

      "abstract": "Stable isotopes in gibbsite and kaolinite were analyzed to reconstruct the Amazonia palaeoclimate during the Cenozoic and to investigate the environmental conditions of the weathering process and the origin of the Oxisol that cover the lateritic/bauxite crust. At least two types of kaolinite were identified in the Oxisol; near the surface, the kaolinite is less fractionated and was developed at a higher temperature (35°C). This is probably due to the effect of vegetation and/or evapotranspiration or is a consequence of surface microenvironmental conditions or allochthonous inputs. The other kaolinite samples ranged in formation temperatures from 21°C to 26°C and developed under conditions similar to the Pleistocene and the modern climate of Amazonia. At least two types of gibbsite were found. One type developed in the modern Amazonia climate, in a way similar to most kaolinite samples, whereas the samples of the other type are more fractionated. This is because they may have been formed in low recycling rainwater and/or under a low amount of precipitation. These two conditions indicate a seasonal climate for bauxite development that can be linked to the low exhumation of the Andes cordillera and its geographical position relative to the Trombetas region during the period ranging from the Late Oligocene to the Early Miocene. At the end of the Cenozoic, the climate was less seasonal and wetter and the temperature was lower In addition, there was the probable inland position of the Trombetas region, which allowed Oxisol development. The gibbsite developed earlier than the kaolinite of the Oxisol, but there is a partial inheritance, or temporal equivalence, among the bauxite horizon and the Oxisol, as well as multiple generations of gibbsite and kaolinite, which is to be expected for materials developing over long periods in hard leaching conditions.",

      "abstract": "We use first field-based observations of precipitation and river isotopic chemistry from a three-year study (2009–2011) in rainforest and nearby savannah in central Guyana at the northern rim of the Amazon rainforest to establish the quality of modelled or remotely-sensed datasets. Our 3 years of data capture a reduced rainfall regime in 2009 and an extended wet season in 2010, in contrast to the widely documented Amazonian floods in 2009 and droughts in 2010. Comparisons of observed precipitation with satellite derived TRMM and ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis precipitation show that both of these data sets capture the general pattern of seasonality, but substantially underestimate rainfall amounts in the primary wet season (by up to 50% and 72% respectively). The TRMM dataset is generally better at characterising the main dry season from September to December but the ERA-Interim model can overestimate precipitation in the dry season by up to 175%. Our new data on isotopic chemistry of river waters show that δ2H/δ18O values in this region are broadly consistent with interpolated global datasets of modelled precipitation isotopic signatures. The dominance of isotopically lighter water derived from the rains of the ITCZ during the wet season provides evidence of the close coupling of water chemistry of headwater rivers on the northern rim of Amazonia to the positioning of the ITCZ over the region. Our results highlight the challenge in understanding and representing local scale hydrological and biogeochemical characteristics using regional scale model data. We argue that combining point and local scale field data with larger scale model data is necessary to progress towards a comprehensive understanding of climate–hydrology interactions in Amazonia.",

      "abstract": "The giant otter, Pteronura brasiliensis, occupies a range including the major drainage basins of South America, yet the degree of structure that exists within and among populations inhabiting these drainages is unknown. We sequenced portions of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome b (612bp) and control region (383bp) genes in order to determine patterns of genetic variation within the species. We found high levels of mtDNA haplotype diversity (h=0.93 overall) and support for subdivision into four distinct groups of populations, representing important centers of genetic diversity and useful units for prioritizing conservation within the giant otter. We tested these results against the predictions of three hypotheses of Amazonian diversification (Pleistocene Refugia, Paleogeography, and Hydrogeology). While the phylogeographic pattern conformed to the predictions of the Refugia Hypothesis, molecular dating using a relaxed clock revealed the phylogroups diverged from one another between 1.69 and 0.84Ma, ruling out the influence of Late Pleistocene glacial refugia. However, the role of Plio-Pleistocene climate change could not be rejected. While the molecular dating also makes the influence of geological arches according to the Paleogeography Hypothesis extremely unlikely, the recent Pliocene formation of the Fitzcarrald Arch and its effect of subsequently altering drainage pattern could not be rejected. The data presented here support the interactions of both climatic and hydrological changes resulting from geological activity in the Plio-Pleistocene, in shaping the phylogeographic structure of the giant otter.",

      "abstract": "We determined individual nest placement patterns for female leatherbacks nesting at Awa:la-Ya:lima:po, French Guiana, by measuring distance from the nest to several landscape features, such as the highest spring tide line (HSTL) and the vegetation line. Distance from the nest to the HSTL differed significantly between females, indicating the existence of individual nesting patterns. There was a significant repeatability of nest site choice relative to the HSTL, indicating that females showed within-individual consistency in their nest placement. Despite individual preferences, there was much within-individual variation and a lack of predictability in the nesting patterns; that is, the locations of subsequent nests could not be predicted based on knowledge of previous nest choices, indicating a certain degree of scatter. The significant repeatability suggests that nest choice behaviour in female leatherbacks is heritable and may show the potential for further evolution. We tested sea-finding ability of hatchlings, a potential consequence of nest site choice, in Matapica, Suriname, by using orientation arenas to quantify the strength and direction of travel after emergence. The orientation tests showed that hatchlings were unable to move seaward in vegetated arenas, providing evidence that vegetation acts as a strong selective pressure driving nest placement seaward. It appears that leatherbacks have adopted a regional rather than a local optimum for nest placement patterns, possibly resulting from their weak beach fidelity and the frequent erosion and destruction of their nesting beaches. We discuss the evolutionary and conservation implications for this species in the context of current environmental changes.",

      "abstract": "Bridges are the most vulnerable assets of our transport networks. They are disproportionately exposed to and hit by multiple natural hazards, with flooding being the leading cause of bridge failures in the world. Their performance is constantly challenged by the combined effects of natural hazard stressors, e.g. flash floods, exacerbated by climate change, ageing, increasing traffic volumes and loads. Bridges are vulnerable to scour and other flood-related impacts, such as hydraulic forces and debris accumulation. In order to assess and quantify the resilience of flood-critical bridges and subsequently deploy bridge resilience models aiming at building resilience into transport networks, it is essential to use reliable fragility, capacity restoration and traffic reinstatement metrics and models. It is surprising that, despite the importance of bridges and their high vulnerability to hydraulic actions, there are no available recovery models. The latter can help quantify the pace of post-flood capacity and functionality gain for facilitating well-informed decision making for reliable prioritisation and efficient allocation of resources in transport networks. The main barrier is the nature and complexity of recovery actions, which encompass engineering, operational, owner resources and organisational challenges, among others. This paper, for the first time in the international literature, aims at filling this gap by generating a set of reliable recovery models that include both bridge reinstatement (traffic capacity) and restoration (structural capacity) models based on a detailed questionnaire that elicits knowledge from experts. Recovery models are then presented and validate-partsd for spread and deep foundations for a typical reinforced concrete bridge, including restoration task prioritisation and scheduling, inter-task dependencies, idle times, durations and cost ratios for different damage levels, as well as the evolution of traffic capacity after floods.",

      "abstract": "Forest canopies are dynamic interfaces between organisms and atmosphere, providing buffered microclimates and complex microhabitats. Canopies form vertically stratified ecosystems interconnected with other strata. Some forest biodiversity patterns and food webs have been documented and measurements of ecophysiology and biogeochemical cycling have allowed analyses of large-scale transfer of CO2, water, and trace gases between forests and the atmosphere. However, many knowledge gaps remain. With global research networks and databases, and new technologies and infrastructure, we envisage rapid advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that drive the spatial and temporal dynamics of forests and their canopies. Such understanding is vital for the successful management and conservation of global forests and the ecosystem services they provide to the world.",

Foodborne diseases are an important cause of morbidity and mortality. The types of diseases and their impacts are diverse in different communities and on public health. The estimated global burden of foodborne disease is considerable for each region, but it is impossible to be fully aware of all unsafe foods that cause illness. A portion of foodborne disease is recognized and reported to public health authorities and recorded in official disease statistics.

      "abstract": "Research has repeatedly shown that ongoing habitat loss and the increasing frequency of extreme climatic events have altered fundamental biological processes, threatening biodiversity and ecosystem functioning worldwide. However, the multitude of interacting factors underlying the impacts of these threats remain poorly understood in tropical forests. This is unfortunate because the majority of terrestrial biodiversity resides in these habitats. The responses of organisms to environmental changes are often studied indirectly, for example, using discrete snapshots at different time periods at the same location. This is due to the challenges of compiling long-term data, especially for invertebrates. Evaluating how functionally important species assemblages will respond to anthropogenic threats requires continuous long-term monitoring. This is vital for arthropods because they are responsible for crucial ecosystem services and human food security. Here, we review existing arthropod monitoring schemes and consider some innovative avenues for future research that promise to improve monitoring of this important group in tropical systems.",

      "abstract": "Background\nTungiasis is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) found in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. Despite the high frequency in marginalized populations, little information is available on the geography and estimates of the population at risk in endemic regions. Here we used a geostatistical model to map the potential geographic distribution of areas suitable for tungiasis transmission in Latin America and estimated the at-risk population.\nMethods\nWe developed an ecological niche model (ENM) using tungiasis occurrence records and remotely sensed environmental and socioeconomic data. The potential geographic distribution was then compared to the current population distribution of the region to derive the total population living in urban and rural areas.\nFindings\nWe identified a total of 138 records of occurrences of tungiasis in Latin America, ranging from Mexico to Argentina; 27 reports were not included in the modeling, due to missing detailed geographic information. The occurrences with detailed geographic information (n = 112) included 17 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. The locations were in environments that primarily consisted of forests (29%), croplands (16•5%), and shrublands (10•9%). We predicted environmentally suitable areas for tungiasis transmission in 45 countries. The estimated human population living in these areas is 450,546,547 with urban centers accounting for 347,007,103 and rural areas 103,539,444. Countries with significant ecological suitability and documented occurrences include Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, French Guyana, Guatemala, Haiti, Paraguay, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela.\nInterpretation\nThis is the first study mapping the potential distribution of tungiasis in Latin America, evidencing the need for population-based studies and elaboration of integrated control measures.\nFunding\nThis project was supported in part by an appointment to the Research Participation Program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention administered by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education through an interagency agreement between the U.S. Department of Energy and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

      "abstract": "Globally, sea levels are rising due to climate change which would influence the salinity levels in mangroves. In the framework of this study, we focused on the influence of salinity and differences of forest structure on the fine root biomass (FRB) and carbon stocks in the Sundarbans mangrove forest, Bangladesh. Also, the relationships FRB to different stand structural parameters were investigated using the data obtained from 50 sample plots (100 sq. m each) in different salinity zones in Sundarbans. Four random soil samples (30 cm in length) were taken within study plots, which were further divided into 10 cm, 20 cm, and 30 cm to identify the most active soil layer for FRB stocks. Results suggest differences in forest structural parameters and diversity indices with salinity changes in different saline zones. The low and medium saline zone is dominated by Heriteira fomes, while Excoecaria agallocha dominates the high saline zone. The carbon stocks (Mg C ha−1) in Sundarbans show a significant decrease with increasing salinity in different saline zones, e.g. oligohaline (252 ± 60.2), mesohaline (199 ± 37.7), and polyhaline (171 ± 20.0) zone. FRB carbon (Mg C ha−1) allocation in different saline zones also followed a decreasing order, such as oligohaline (12.8), mesohaline (7.9), and polyhaline (7.3). Fine root biomass showed a decreasing trend with increasing soil depth, where the differences, however, were not significant (p > 0.05) among the soil layers. Our results provide evidence on FRB variations in Sundarbans, which has implications on the mangrove species conservation and management. The mature stands at different saline zones of Sundarbans mangrove forest, Bangladesh has a high fine root biomass, which is valuable for mangrove restoration and the studied species plantation in the shore line or coastal area which can help to decrease the erosion effects of tidal inundation.",

      "abstract": "The Caribbean nation of Suriname has historically depended on a mix of hydropower and oil-based fossil fuels for meeting electricity needs. Continued reliance on fossil fuels poses challenges both for climate change mitigation and for energy security. This paper explores the potential for increasing the share of renewables in Suriname's electricity mix, with a special focus on the complementary role of existing hydropower and future wind power infrastructure. We show that these resources have great synergetic potential for displacing fossil fuel-based power generation. Flexible operation of the Afobaka hydropower plant, newly in full possession of Suriname, allows significant wind power integration without violating grid stability and associated power quality requirements. Considering the trade-off between displacing expensive fossil fuels and limiting wind power curtailment on Suriname's island-like grid, our results suggest that integrating wind power in the Surinamese electricity mix is economically advantageous up to a share of 20–30%, independently of near-term demand growth. These results have wider relevance for climate policy in various Caribbean countries and other island states with existing hydropower infrastructure and substantial wind/solar power potential, for which this study fills an important literature gap.",

      "abstract": "The Demerara plateau, located offshore French Guiana and Suriname, is part of a passive transform continental margin particularly prone to develop slope instabilities, probably in relation to the presence of a free distal border along its steep continental slope. Slope failure occurred at different periods (Cretaceous to Neogene) and shows an overall retrogressive evolution through time. Upslope these failure headscarp, an enigmatic regional Mio-Pliocene unconformity has been discovered through the interpretation of new academic and industrial datasets. The aim of this work is to describe and understand the origin of this surface. Our analysis shows that this unconformity is made of a series of valleys that cross-cut sedimentary strata. Each one of these valleys has a short lateral extent and is closed along two perpendicular directions, which suggests that it could correspond to a highly meandering system, or to some sub-circular depressions. The infill of these features is equivalent to the regional stratigraphic strata found outside the structures, but in a subdued position. This seems to imply that the structures have originated by a local loss of sediments at their base or by sliding processes. Furthermore, these depressions intersect each other through time, while migrating progressively downslope. We discuss a series of hypotheses that try to explain the onset and evolution of these depressions forming the Mio-Pliocene unconformity (Canyons? Slope failures? Contourite moats? Hydrate pockmarks?). Having established that these structures are depressions formed by collapse, and have many similarities with structures recently described in the literature as pockmarks associated with gas hydrate dissolution, we favor this hypothesis. We propose that these hydrate pockmarks form with a mass failure that was triggered by fluid-overpressure development at the base of the hydrate stability zone.",

      "abstract": "Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) are exceptionally voluminous magmatic events frequently related to continental break-up, global climate changes and mass extinctions. One interesting aspect of many LIPs is their spatial proximity to cratons, begging the question of a potential control of thick lithosphere on their emplacement. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the emplacement of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) and the thick lithospheric mantle of the Precambrian cratons that formed the central portion of Pangea and are currently located on the continents surrounding the Central Atlantic Ocean. CAMP outcrops are frequently located over the margins of the thick cratonic keels, as imaged by recent tomographic studies, suggesting a role of lithosphere architecture in controlling magma genesis and emplacement. Here we focus on CAMP dykes and sills from the Hank, Hodh, and Kaarta basins in North-Western Africa (NW-Africa, Mali and Mauritania) emplaced at the edge of the Reguibat and Leo-Man Shields. The investigated intrusive rocks show compositions similar to most CAMP magmas, in particular those of the Tiourjdal geochemical group, limited to NW-Africa, and of the Prevalent group, occurring all over the CAMP. Geochemical modelling of CAMP basalts requires a Depleted MORB Mantle (DMM) source enriched by recycled continental crust (1-4%) and melting beneath a lithosphere of ca. 80 km in thickness. On the contrary, melting under a significantly thicker lithosphere (>110 km) does not produce magmas with compositions similar to those of CAMP basalts. This suggests that CAMP magmatism was likely favoured by decompression-induced partial melting of the upwelling asthenospheric mantle along the steep lithospheric boundaries of stable cratons. The architecture of the pre-existing lithosphere (i.e., the presence of stable thick cratonic keels juxtaposed to relatively thinner lithosphere) appears to have been a critical factor for localizing mantle upwelling and partial melting during extensive magmatic events such as in the CAMP.",

      "abstract": "Mangrove forests rank as one of the world's most productive biomes and their soils are highly efficient in accumulating organic carbon (OC). Most research on OC in mangrove forests has focused on moist tropical and sub-tropical regions. Here we examine an arid mangrove forest (composed of the species Avicennia marina) from the Jask area in southern Iran. The organic carbon content, TOC:TN ratios and δ13C signatures indicate that marine algae and microalgae are a greater source of organic material than the terrestrial inputs at three out of the four study sites in this work. Furthermore, sea-level rise as well as geomorphic and topographic differences are contributing to the mangrove landward migration and expansion of 112 ha (or 33%) of these arid forests between 1956 and 2012. This is substantial as up to 0.60 g OC cm−2 were found in the upper 42 cm of the soils. However, these values should be taken with caution as the large inorganic carbon deposition in the soils here and in other regions may offset the CO2 sequestration of the global arid mangroves in terms of climate mitigation.",

      "abstract": "In this article, numerical experiments are performed to investigate the effects of increasing atmospheric moisture on the precipitation depth (PD) produced by Hurricane Ivan (2004) over a target area, chosen as the drainage basin of the city of Asheville, NC. Atmospheric moisture was increased indirectly by increasing the sea surface temperature (SST) in the simulation initial conditions, and by letting the regional atmospheric model adjust the atmospheric fields to the SST perturbation. The SST was increased in two ways: 1) using spatially constant increments and 2) using a climate change perturbation field obtained from a climate projection. For each SST scenario, the PD over the target area was maximized by using a physically based storm transposition method. Although the mean PD, that was obtained by averaging over all shifting increments, increased with SST, the maximum PD was obtained for the case of no SST increase. It was found that, in the case of no SST increase, the worst-case tropical cyclone track was significantly different than in the SST increase scenarios. In particular, in this case, the storm spent a longer time in the simulation inner domain, thus spawning a larger PD over the target area.",

      "abstract": "We review literature relevant to assessing the future of tropical forests and supplement the review with new data from the lowlands of Venezuela. Compared to today, future tropical forests will have a higher level of novelty, defined as the degree of dissimilarity of a system relative to a historical baseline. Processes of succession and evolution generate novelty in forests and have done so for millennia. Under increasing human activity and climate change, the rate of generation of novelty has increased and the resulting forests are termed novel forests to distinguish them from historical forests. Historical forests are less exposed to anthropogenic disturbances and operate at slower levels of novelty generation. Acclimation, adaptation, changes in species composition and dominance, and changes in the proportions of species in communities are the responses of the biota to climate change and anthropogenic disturbances. Therefore, novelty contributes to the persistence of tropical forests in spite of increasing levels of human activity. Novel forests are similar to historical forests in terms of structure but they are younger, they have a faster turnover of mass and chemical elements, and different species composition. Historical species assemblages cannot cope with the altered environments that result from chronic anthropogenic disturbances. The dominant species in novel forests tend to be, and function as, pioneer species. High levels of species dominance in novel forests influence the proportions of chemical elements, which when coupled to species traits and attributes, help explain how novel forests cope with the conditions that result from anthropogenic activities. Novelty is more common in the tropics than in other latitudinal regions, and within the tropics, it is more common in islands where human activity is more intense than in continents. Novel tropical forests in islands have greater representation and dominance of introduced species than novel forests in continents, where native species with wide geographic distributions dominate. Regardless of geography, novel tropical forests share similar attributes and functioning. The adaptability of novel forests to extreme conditions created by human activity signals a future for tropical forests that is different from predictions of constant degradation, homogenization, and loss of biodiversity. Instead, a process of recombination of species (all taxa) into new species assemblages maintains structure, function, physiognomy, species richness, and ecological services. This remixing initially involves loss of large organisms, certain groups of species, and loss of old-growth attributes of forests. Some of these losses can be reversed through succession, assuming there is sufficient time to restore depleted stores such as soil organic matter. Continued environmental change will stimulate continued remixing of species, loss of vulnerable species, gains of less vulnerable ones, and more dissimilarity with historical forests. Novel forests are an answer to the changes induced by climate change and other anthropogenic disturbances, and as such require conservation measures, because as they mature, novel forests usually diversify and help restore lost biodiversity. We also review strategies to conserve biodiversity and optimize ecological services using novel forest succession.",

      "abstract": "The green credentials of hydroelectricity in terms of greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions have been tarnished with the finding of the researches on GHG emissions from hydroelectric reservoirs in the last two decades. Substantial amounts of GHGs release from the tropical reservoirs, especially methane (CH4) from Brazil’s Amazonian areas. CH4 contributes strongly to climate change because it has a global warming potential (GWP) 24times higher than carbon dioxide (CO2) on a per molecule basis over a 100-year time horizon. GHGs may emit from reservoirs through four different pathways to the atmosphere: (1) diffusive flux at the reservoir surface, (2) gas bubble flux in the shallow zones of a reservoir, (3) water degassing flux at the outlet of the powerhouse downstream of turbines and spillways, and (4) flux across the air–water interface in the rivers downstream of the dams. This paper reviewed the productions and emissions of CH4, CO2, and N2O in reservoirs, and the environmental variables influencing CH4 and CO2 emissions were also summarized. Moreover, the paper combined with the progress of GHG emissions from Three Gorges Reservoir and proposed three crucial problems to be resolved on GHG emissions from reservoirs at present, which would be benefit to estimate the total GHG emissions from Three Gorges Reservoir accurately.",

      "abstract": "Introduction\nNeglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in developing countries like the Caribbean, negatively affect multiple income-generating sectors, including the tourism industry upon which island states are highly dependent. Insect-transmitted NTDs include, but are not limited to, malaria, dengue and lymphatic filariasis. Control measures for these disease, are often ignored because of the associated cost. Many of the developing country members are thus retained in a financially crippling cycle, balancing the cost of prophylactic measures with that of controlling an outbreak. The purpose of the paper is to bring awareness to NTDs transmitted by insects of importance to humans, and to assess factors affecting such control, in the English-speaking Caribbean.\nMethod\nComprehensive literature review on reports pertaining to NTDs transmitted by insects in the Caribbean and Latin America was conducted. Data search was carried out on PubMed, and WHO and PAHO websites.\nResults and conclusion\nPotential risk factors for NTDs transmitted by arthropods in the English-speaking Caribbean are summarised. The mosquito appears to be the main insect-vector of human importance within the region of concern. Arthropod-vectors of diseases of veterinary importance are also relevant because they affect the livelihood of farmers, in highly agriculture based economies. Other NTDs may also be in circulation gauged by the presence of antibodies in Caribbean individuals. However, routine diagnostic tests for specific diseases are expensive and tests may not be conducted when diseases are not prevalent in the population. It appears that only a few English-speaking Caribbean countries have examined secondary reservoirs of pathogens or assessed the effectivity of their insect control methods. As such, disease risk assessment appears incomplete. Although continuous control is financially demanding, an integrated and multisectoral approach might help to deflect the cost. Such interventions are now being promoted by health agencies within the region and various countries are creating and exploring the use of novel tools to be incorporated in their insect-vector control programmes.",

      "abstract": "The combined effects of isolation within an unfavourable matrix and vegetation development were studied in patches of scrub vegetation on a tropical inselberg (Nouragues, French Guiana). Three thickets ∼10m2 area were sampled, located at ∼30m distance from each other, in which the same vegetation types were present at less than 3m distance: canopies of Clusia minor (Clusiaceae) and Myrcia saxatilis (Myrtaceae), two stages of thicket development, and zones of destruction by fire. The shallow organic soil was sampled over ∼2dm2 and down to 10cm. The matrix was comprised of granite without any soil development. Arthropods were classified into morphospecies and their food diets were characterized by optical methods. The effect of isolation (between-thicket variation) on morphospecies composition was negligible, while that of vegetation type and fire (within-thicket variation) was prominent, as ascertained by principal component analysis and tested by partial redundance analysis. The importance of keystone structures (stages of vegetation development) was stressed, and interpreted to the light of taxonomic and foodweb knowledge.",

      "abstract": "Background\nCutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) has traditionally been underrecognized and underreported. Improved awareness is warranted as the number of cases has increased as a result of increased travel to endemic countries, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and the larger number of military and contract workers deployed overseas.\nObjective\nWe sought to present a systematic review of evidence from a gamut of research trials on the treatment efficacy of different regimens and aggregate this knowledge for use as a guide for clinical practice decisions.\nMethods\nWe performed a comprehensive search of print and electronic sources to identify the accumulated research information on New World CL.\nResults\nTopical treatment of New World CL lesions is generally not recommended. Findings support the systemic administration of pentavalent antimonials as first-line treatment. Exception to this is infection with L guyanensis in French Guiana where systemic pentamidine is suggested as first-line treatment.\nLimitations\nThe reliability of the findings of this review of research evidence is dependent on the individual quality and potential bias in its component principal trials. There was a conscious attempt to only include evidence derived from randomized controlled studies, with adequate randomization, adequate patient numbers, and complete follow-up information. However, because of the relatively small number of such studies on New World CL, evidence from nonrandomized studies and case series studies was also considered.\nConclusions\nThe pentavalent antimony compounds remain the first-line treatment choice for the treatment of New World CL. Concerns with cost, availability, poor compliance, and systemic toxicity, however, may compel clinicians to opt for alternative treatment modalities. Some advances in the development of an antileishmanial vaccine have been made but none is yet available for clinic use. The increase, over recent years, in the incidence of CL warrants an enhanced effort to increase awareness of the disease, assure timely diagnosis, and implement effective management and treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "The effects of climate change on the lowland vegetation of Amazonia during the last glacial cycle are partially known for the middle and late Pleniglacial intervals (late MIS 3, 59–24 ka and MIS 2, 24–11 ka), but are still unclear for older stages of the last glacial and during the last interglacial. It is known that a more seasonal dry-wet climate caused marginal forest retraction and together with cooling rearranged forest composition to some extent. This is observed in pollen records across Amazonia depicting presence of taxa at glacial times in localities where they do not live presently. The understanding of taxa migration is hindered by the lack of continuous interglacial-glacial lowland records. We present new data from a known locality in NW Amazonia (Six Lakes Hill), showing a vegetation record that probably started during MIS 5 (130–71 ka) and lasted until the onset of the Holocene. The vegetation record unravels a novel pattern in tree taxa migration: (1) from the beginning of this cycle Podocarpus and Myrsine are recorded and (2) only later do Hedyosmum and Alnus appear. The latter group is largely restricted to montane biomes or more distant locations outside Amazonia, whereas the first is found in lowlands close to the study site on sandy soils. These findings imply that Podocarpus and Myrsine responded to environmental changes equally and this reflects their concomitant niche use in NW Amazonia. Temperature drop is not discarded as a trigger of internal forest composition change, but its effects are clearer later in the Pleniglacial rather than the Early Glacial. Therefore early climatic/environmental changes had a first order effect on vegetation that invoke alternative explanations. We claim last glacial climate-induced modifications on forest composition favoured the expansion of geomorphologic-soil related processes that initiated forest rearrangement.",

We studied the consequences of drought on the concentrations, stoichiometries and stocks of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in leaves, foliar litter of a three dominant woody species and soil of a Mediterranean montane holm oak forest where soil-water content was experimentally reduced (15 % lower than the control plots) for 15 years. Nitrogen stocks were lower in the drought plots than in the control plots (8.81 ± 1.01 kg ha−1 in the forest canopy and 856 ± 120 kg ha−1 in the 0−15 cm soil layer), thus representing 7 and 18 % lower N stocks in the canopy and soil respectively. δ15N was consistently higher under drought conditions in all samples, indicating a general loss of N. Foliar C and K stocks were also lower but to a lesser extent than N. Decreases in biomass and C and N stocks due to drought were smallest for the most dominant tall shrub, Phillyrea latifolia, so our results suggest a lower capacity of this forest to store C and nutrients but also substantial resulting changes in forest structure with increasing drought.",

      "abstract": "Parties to the Paris Agreement have a binding obligation to collectively limit global temperature rises to an agreed upon target. Commitments include providing national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory reports to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (‘UNFCCC’) secretariat, reporting their contributions towards the collective target. GHG emissions from upstream oil and gas (O&G) facilities, including those in offshore areas under coastal State jurisdiction (where current activity is occurring in over 50 countries), are to be included within the scope of these reports. Parties to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (‘UNCLOS’) are obligated to adopt and enforce laws and regulations to prevent, reduce, and control pollution arising from seabed exploration and exploitation activities under their jurisdiction. These are to be no less effective than international rules and standards as established through competent international organisations. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), via the Regional Seas Programmes (RSP), are two such organisations that develop international rules and standards covering certain aspects of offshore O&G activities. IMO treaties, rules, and standards cover GHG emissions arising from vessel-related offshore O&G activities, but emissions from O&G industry-specific activities, such as the venting and flaring of reservoir hydrocarbons, are excluded. The only other source of international law, implementing UNCLOS′ requirement, providing international rules and standards for coastal States to benchmark their laws against for the prevention of marine pollution in the form of GHG emissions from offshore O&G activities are the regional instruments of the RSP. However, as this article will show, current RSP coverage is minimal and insufficient, particularly in light of Parties' Paris Agreement and UNCLOS obligations. Examples are provided showing inconsistencies in the reporting of offshore O&G GHG emissions across national inventory reports, as well as examples of applicable requirements prescribed under various RSP instruments, or lack thereof, highlighting the deficiency of a relevant international pollution prevention rule and/or standard across all marine regions.",

      "abstract": "Between 2012 and 2015, a severe drought and the consequent decrease in water supply in the southeastern region of Brazil reached concerning levels, leading to a water crisis. This situation caused aerial exposure of some reservoirs drawdown zone. This study aims to measure methane fluxes emitted by this drawdown zone along the Funil hydropower reservoir, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It was observed that there was a temporal variation of the methane flux in the sediments exposed in the three scenarios studied: drought, flooding and full (0.43, −0.31 and −0.01 mg CH4 m-2 h-1, respectively). The CH4 flux by area in the scenario with the highest exposed sediment area was 0.195 ton CH4 d-1. Considering the values recorded, the contribution of these emissions must become considered in the overall balance of methane in the atmosphere as a new pathway by reservoirs, mainly with the expected forecasts and possible cycles of droughts that may occur frequently. However, the temporal variability of these fluxes indicated the need for future monitoring initiatives that seek to understand how climate change affects the biochemical processes within the exposed sediments of drawdown zones.",

      "abstract": "Although some associations between the leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea and the Gulf Stream current have been previously suggested, no study has to date-parts demonstrated strong affinities between leatherback movements and this particular frontal system using thorough oceanographic data in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions. The importance of the Gulf Stream frontal system in the selection of high residence time (HRT) areas by the North Atlantic leatherback turtle is assessed here for the first time using state-of-the-art ocean reanalysis products. Ten adult females from the Eastern French Guianese rookery were satellite tracked during post-nesting migration to relate (1) their horizontal movements to physical gradients (Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Sea Surface Height (SSH) and filaments) and biological variables (micronekton and chlorophyll a), and (2) their diving behaviour to vertical structures within the water column (mixed layer, thermocline, halocline and nutricline). All the turtles migrated northward towards the Gulf Stream north wall. Although their HRT areas were geographically remote (spread between 80–30°W and 28–45 °N), all the turtles targeted similar habitats in terms of physical structures, i.e. strong gradients of SST, SSH and a deep mixed layer. This close association with the Gulf Stream frontal system highlights the first substantial synchronization ever observed in this species, as the HRTs were observed in close match with the autumn phytoplankton bloom. Turtles remained within the enriched mixed layer at depths of 38.5±7.9m when diving in HRT areas, likely to have an easier access to their prey and maximize therefore the energy gain. These depths were shallow in comparison to those attained within the thermocline (82.4±5.6m) while crossing the nutrient-poor subtropical gyre, probably to reach cooler temperatures and save energy during the transit. In a context of climate change, anticipating the evolution of such frontal structure under the influence of global warming is crucial to ensure the conservation of this vulnerable species.",

      "abstract": "Changes in above-ground biomass (AGB) of 17 1ha logged plots of terra firme rain forest in the eastern Amazon (Brazil, Paragominas) were monitored for four years (2004–2008) after reduced-impact logging. Over the same time period, we also monitored two 0.5ha plots in adjacent unlogged forest. While AGB in the control plots changed little over the observation period (increased on average 1.4Mgha−1), logging resulted in immediate reductions in ABG that averaged 94.5Mgha−1 (±42.0), which represented 23% of the 410Mgha−1 (±64.9) present just prior to harvesting. Felled trees (dbh>55cm) accounted for 73% (±15) of these immediate losses but only 18.9Mgha−1 (±8.1) of biomass was removed in the extracted logs. During the first year after logging, the annual AGB balance (annual AGB gain by recruitment and growth−annual AGB loss by mortality) remained negative (−31.1Mgha−1year−1; ±16.7), mainly due to continued high mortality rates of damaged trees. During the following three years (2005–2008), average net AGB accumulation in the logged plots was 2.6Mgha−1year−1 (±4.6). Post-logging biomass recovery was mostly through growth (4.3±1.5Mgha−1year−1 for 2004–2005 and 6.8±0.9Mgha−1year−1 for 2005–2008), particularly of large trees. In contrast, tree recruitment contributed little to the observed increases in AGB (1.1±0.6Mgha−1year−1 for 2004–2005 and 3.1±1.3Mgha−1year−1 for 2005–2008). Plots with the lowest residual basal area after logging generally continued to lose more large trees (dbh ≥70cm), and consequently showed the greatest AGB losses and the slowest overall AGB gains. If 100% AGB recovery is desired and the 30-year minimum cutting cycle defined by Brazilian law is adhered to, current logging intensities (6treesha−1) need to be reduced by 40–50%. Such a reduction in logging intensity will reduce financial incomes to loggers, but might be compensated for by the payment of environmental services through the proposed REDD (reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) mechanism of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.",

      "abstract": "Vertebrate population densities were quantified in lowland central Guyana using line-transect censuses at three forest sites subjected to reduced-impact logging (RIL), and three adjacent unlogged sites. We censused a range of forest vertebrate species including large canopy-dwelling and terrestrial birds, three primates, one rodent and one tortoise. Two 4km transects at each site were repeatedly surveyed during the wet season of 2008 to derive population density estimates on the basis of a cumulative survey effort of 416km. RIL had ended within 16 months, and sites had been subjected to a mean extraction rate of 3.9m3ha−1, equivalent to only 1.1treesha−1. Three of the 15 vertebrate species examined here exhibited significantly different abundances at forest RIL sites, two of which were negative. Large frugivores such as primates were less abundant in sites subject to RIL, whereas smaller frugivores, granivores, folivores and insectivores were more common in logged sites. We are unable to reliably distinguish between responses of different taxonomic groups, since robust abundance metrics could only be estimated for four mammal species. Despite this, species traits including dietary guild, body mass, home range size and vertical stratification of forest use are used to explain varying responses. Our findings suggest that responsible reduced-impact logging practices in neotropical forests can be considered as a relatively benign form of forest management that can coexist with the requirements of both local economies and biodiversity conservation. However, our study sites experienced comparably low extraction rates, and detrimental effects such as hunting were low. Our results therefore provide an opportunity to scrutinise the effects of best practice logging systems, though do not necessarily represent typical circumstances across tropical forests.",

      "abstract": "Some 90% of the Guyanese population are at risk from contemporary flood hazard and the potential impacts of climate change and sea-level rise. Such risks are not the product of physical systems alone, and by using a political ecology frame the geography of flood hazard in urban environments can be seen to coevolve with political, social and economic systems. These systems are explored by a historical review which traces the roots of present vulnerability to the colonial experience, and an analysis of contemporary vulnerabilities which draws from a peri-urban and an urban case study. The case studies show that the current fashion in international donor agencies to fund ‘community sponsored development’ has missed an opportunity to enhance security through grassroots empowerment, and rather that those community organisations associated with this system have been co-opted by political elites reproducing embedded distributions of power and vulnerability.",

      "abstract": "The future of tropical biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes will be conservation and restoration of processes of seed dispersal by birds and mammals. Here the Diversity Storage Hypothesis posits that immense biological diversity resides within skewed species-abundance distributions of tropical trees, and further predicts that many species will adjust to increases of 1.5–3.0 °C anticipated from climate change by 2100. Common and widespread tropical trees (>100,000,000 individuals) may shift ranges but are unlikely to face extinction. Many rare species (e.g. <1000 individuals) have a more precarious future. The latter may be declining species bound for extinction, incipient species adjusting to environmental changes, or relics of past warmer and more seasonal climates that will be resurrected if processes of seed dispersal allow them to persist and spread. In fragmented agricultural landscapes, preserved or planted corridors, buffers and stepping-stone habitat patches around and between forest remnants are more vital than efforts to preserve or create contemporary forest compositions, dominance relations, and species-abundance distributions. An implication of Diversity Storage is that it is more important to facilitate migration into and out of changing landscapes to allow inherent diversity to adjust and coexist with agricultural economies than to resist change.",

      "abstract": "Amazonian rivers function as important barriers to dispersal of Amazonian birds. Studying population genetics of lineages separated by rivers may help us to uncover the dynamics of biological diversification in the Amazon. We reconstructed the phylogeography of the Wedge-billed Woodcreeper, Glyphorynchus spirurus (Furnariidae) in the Amazon basin. Sampling included 134 individuals from 63 sites distributed in eight Amazonian areas of endemism separated by major Amazonian rivers. Nucleotide sequences were generated for five genes: two mtDNA genes (1047bp for cyt b and 1002bp for ND2) and three nuclear genes (647bp from the sex-linked gene ACO, 319bp from the intron of G3PDH, and 619bp from intron 2 of MYO). In addition, 37 individuals were randomly selected from the Rondônia and Inambari areas of endemism for genomic fingerprinting, using five ISSR primers. Our results reveal allopatric and well-supported lineages within G. spirurus with high levels of genetic differentiation (p-distances 0.9–6.3%) across opposite banks of major Amazonian rivers. The multilocus phylogenetic reconstructions obtained reveal several incongruences with current subspecies taxonomy. Within currently recognized subspecies, we found high levels of both paraphyly and genetic differentiation, indicating deep divergences and strong isolation consistent with species-level differences. ISSR fingerprinting supports the existence of genetically differentiated populations on opposite sides of the Madeira River. Molecular dating suggests an initial vicariation event isolating populations from the Guiana center of endemism during the Late Miocene/Early Pliocene, while more recent events subdivided Brazilian Shield populations during the Lower Pleistocene.",

      "abstract": "On November 5th, 2015, the Fundão dam collapsed in Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil, releasing millions of cubic meters of mud containing mining residue into the Doce River. Two weeks later, the mud arrived to the marine environment, triggering changes in franciscana dolphin habitat, Pontoporia blainvillei, from Franciscana Management Area Ia. This is an isolated population of the most endangered cetacean species in the South Atlantic Ocean. Organohalogen compounds (OHCs) may pose a threat to this endangered population because of their endocrine disrupting properties. Hence, this study sought to determine if there were differences in the bioaccumulation profile of OHC (PCBs, DDTs, Mirex, HCB, HCHs, PBDEs, PBEB, HBBZ and MeO-BDEs) in franciscana dolphins before and after dam collapse and to build a temporal trend. Blubber of 33 stranded individuals was collected in Espírito Santo state for organohalogen assessment between 2003 and 2019. Differences were found between franciscana dolphins collected prior to and after the disaster. Additionally, significant temporal trends for organochlorine pesticides and natural and anthropogenic organobromine were detected. The increase in pesticide concentrations after 2015 is suggestive of their reavailability in the environment. The decline in organobromine over time could be due to their debromination in the marine environment and alterations in the composition of their natural producers. PCBs remained stable during the period of the study. Our findings show an increase in endocrine disruptor concentrations, which is of great concern for this endangered population.",

CLME and NBSLME, jointly referred to as the CLME+ region). These Large Marine Ecosystems or LMEs provide critical ecosystem services supporting human well-being in this region, particularly for the fisheries and tourism sectors. Unsustainable fisheries, habitat degradation and pollution are three key threats to CLME+ marine ecosystems, and their effects are being exacerbated by climate change. Root causes of these threats include: weak governance; limited human and financial resources; inadequate knowledge; inadequate public awareness and participation; inadequate consideration of the value of ecosystem goods and services; population and cultural pressures; and trade and external dependency. The CLME+ SAP addresses these weaknesses through six distinct strategies aimed at strengthening regional cooperation, institutional reform, and capacity building at the regional, national and local levels over the short (0–5 years) and medium (6–10 years) term. The SAP has been endorsed at the political level by 24 countries and it will be implemented through a partnership approach: “the Global Alliance for the coordinated implementation of the CLME+ SAP” (“CLME+ SAP Alliance”).",

      "abstract": "Tropical forests are the most diverse and productive ecosystems on Earth. While better understanding of these forests is critical for our collective future, until quite recently efforts to measure and monitor them have been largely disconnected. Networking is essential to discover the answers to questions that transcend borders and the horizons of funding agencies. Here we show how a global community is responding to the challenges of tropical ecosystem research with diverse teams measuring forests tree-by-tree in thousands of long-term plots. We review the major scientific discoveries of this work and show how this process is changing tropical forest science. Our core approach involves linking long-term grassroots initiatives with standardized protocols and data management to generate robust scaled-up results. By connecting tropical researchers and elevating their status, our Social Research Network model recognises the key role of the data originator in scientific discovery. Conceived in 1999 with RAINFOR (South America), our permanent plot networks have been adapted to Africa (AfriTRON) and Southeast Asia (T-FORCES) and widely emulated worldwide. Now these multiple initiatives are integrated via ForestPlots.net cyber-infrastructure, linking colleagues from 54 countries across 24 plot networks. Collectively these are transforming understanding of tropical forests and their biospheric role. Together we have discovered how, where and why forest carbon and biodiversity are responding to climate change, and how they feedback on it. This long-term pan-tropical collaboration has revealed a large long-term carbon sink and its trends, as well as making clear which drivers are most important, which forest processes are affected, where they are changing, what the lags are, and the likely future responses of tropical forests as the climate continues to change. By leveraging a remarkably old technology, plot networks are sparking a very modern revolution in tropical forest science. In the future, humanity can benefit greatly by nurturing the grassroots communities now collectively capable of generating unique, long-term understanding of Earth's most precious forests.\nResumen\nLos bosques tropicales son los ecosistemas más diversos y productivos del mundo y entender su funcionamiento es crítico para nuestro futuro colectivo. Sin embargo, hasta hace muy poco, los esfuerzos para medirlos y monitorearlos han estado muy desconectados. El trabajo en redes es esencial para descubrir las respuestas a preguntas que trascienden las fronteras y los plazos de las agencias de financiamiento. Aquí mostramos cómo una comunidad global está respondiendo a los desafíos de la investigación en ecosistemas tropicales a través de diversos equipos realizando mediciones árbol por árbol en miles de parcelas permanentes de largo plazo. Revisamos los descubrimientos más importantes de este trabajo y discutimos cómo este proceso está cambiando la ciencia relacionada a los bosques tropicales. El enfoque central de nuestro esfuerzo implica la conexión de iniciativas locales de largo plazo con protocolos estandarizados y manejo de datos para producir resultados que se puedan trasladar a múltiples escalas. Conectando investigadores tropicales, elevando su posición y estatus, nuestro modelo de Red Social de Investigación reconoce el rol fundamental que tienen, para el descubrimiento científico, quienes generan o producen los datos. Concebida en 1999 con RAINFOR (Suramérica), nuestras redes de parcelas permanentes han sido adaptadas en África (AfriTRON) y el sureste asiático (T-FORCES) y ampliamente replicadas en el mundo. Actualmente todas estas iniciativas están integradas a través de la ciber-infraestructura de ForestPlots.net, conectando colegas de 54 países en 24 redes diferentes de parcelas. Colectivamente, estas redes están transformando nuestro conocimiento sobre los bosques tropicales y el rol de éstos en la biósfera. Juntos hemos descubierto cómo, dónde y porqué el carbono y la biodiversidad de los bosques tropicales está respondiendo al cambio climático y cómo se retroalimentan. Esta colaboración pan-tropical de largo plazo ha expuesto un gran sumidero de carbono y sus tendencias, mostrando claramente cuáles son los factores más importantes, qué procesos se ven afectados, dónde ocurren los cambios, los tiempos de reacción y las probables respuestas futuras mientras el clima continúa cambiando. Apalancando lo que realmente es una tecnología antigua, las redes de parcelas están generando una verdadera y moderna revolución en la ciencia tropical. En el futuro, la humanidad puede beneficiarse enormemente si se nutren y cultivan comunidades de investigadores de base, actualmente con la capacidad de generar información única y de largo plazo para entender los que probablemente son los bosques más preciados de la tierra.\nResumo\nFlorestas tropicais são os ecossistemas mais diversos e produtivos da Terra. Embora uma boa compreensão destas florestas seja crucial para o nosso futuro coletivo, até muito recentemente os esforços de medições e monitoramento tem sido amplamente desconexos. É essencial formarmos redes para obtermos respostas que transcendam as fronteiras e horizontes das agências financiadoras. Neste estudo nós mostramos como uma comunidade global está respondendo aos desafios da pesquisa de ecossistemas tropicais, com equipes diversas medindo florestas, árvore por árvore, em milhares de parcelas monitoradas a longo prazo. Nós revisamos as maiores descobertas científicas deste esforço global, e mostramos também como este processo vem mudando a ciência de florestas tropicais. Nossa abordagem principal envolve unir iniciativas de base a protocolos padronizados e gerenciamento de dados a fim de gerar resultados robustos em grandes escalas. Ao conectar pesquisadores tropicais e elevar seus status, nosso modelo de Rede de Pesquisa Social reconhece o papel chave do produtor dos dados na descoberta científica. Concebida em 1999 com o RAINFOR (América do Sul), nossa rede de parcelas permanentes foi adaptada para África (AfriTRON) e Sudeste Asiático (T-FORCES), e tem sido extensamente reproduzida em todo o mundo. Agora estas múltiplas iniciativas estão integradas através da infraestrutura cibernética do ForestPlots.net, conectando colegas de 54 países e 24 redes de parcelas. Estas iniciativas estão transformando coletivamente o entendimento das florestas tropicais e seus papéis na biosfera. Juntos nós descobrimos como, onde e por que o carbono e a biodiversidade da floresta estão respondendo às mudanças climáticas, e seus efeitos de retroalimentação. Esta duradoura colaboração pantropical revelou um grande sumidouro de carbono persistente e suas tendências, assim como tem evidenciado quais os fatores que influenciam essas tendências, quais processos florestais são mais afetados, onde eles estão mudando, seus atrasos no tempo de resposta, e as prováveis respostas das florestas tropicais conforme o clima continua a mudar. Dessa forma, aproveitando uma notável tecnologia antiga, redes de parcelas acendem as faíscas de uma moderna revolução na ciência das florestas tropicais. No futuro a humanidade pode se beneficiar incentivando estas comunidades locais que agora são coletivamente capazes de gerar conhecimentos únicos e duradouros sobre as florestas mais preciosas da Terra.\nRésume\nLes forêts tropicales sont les écosystèmes les plus diversifiés et les plus productifs de la planète. Si une meilleure compréhension de ces forêts est essentielle pour notre avenir collectif, jusqu'à tout récemment, les efforts déployés pour les mesurer et les surveiller ont été largement déconnectés. La mise en réseau est essentielle pour découvrir les réponses à des questions qui dépassent les frontières et les horizons des organismes de financement. Nous montrons ici comment une communauté mondiale relève les défis de la recherche sur les écosystèmes tropicaux avec diverses équipes qui mesurent les forêts arbre après arbre dans de milliers de parcelles permanentes. Nous passons en revue les principales découvertes scientifiques de ces travaux et montrons comment ce processus modifie la science des forêts tropicales. Notre approche principale consiste à relier les initiatives de base à long terme à des protocoles standardisés et une gestion de données afin de générer des résultats solides à grande échelle. En reliant les chercheurs tropicaux et en élevant leur statut, notre modèle de réseau de recherche sociale reconnaît le rôle clé de l'auteur des données dans la découverte scientifique. Conçus en 1999 avec RAINFOR (Amérique du Sud), nos réseaux de parcelles permanentes ont été adaptés à l'Afrique (AfriTRON) et à l'Asie du Sud-Est (T-FORCES) et largement imités dans le monde entier. Ces multiples initiatives sont désormais intégrées via l'infrastructure ForestPlots.net, qui relie des collègues de 54 pays à travers 24 réseaux de parcelles. Ensemble, elles transforment la compréhension des forêts tropicales et de leur rôle biosphérique. Ensemble, nous avons découvert comment, où et pourquoi le carbone forestier et la biodiversité réagissent au changement climatique, et comment ils y réagissent. Cette collaboration pan-tropicale à long terme a révélé un important puits de carbone à long terme et ses tendances, tout en mettant en évidence les facteurs les plus importants, les processus forestiers qui sont affectés, les endroits où ils changent, les décalages et les réactions futures probables des forêts tropicales à mesure que le climat continue de changer. En tirant parti d'une technologie remarquablement ancienne, les réseaux de parcelles déclenchent une révolution très moderne dans la science des forêts tropicales. À l'avenir, l'humanité pourra grandement bénéficier du soutien des communautés de base qui sont maintenant collectivement capables de générer une compréhension unique et à long terme des forêts les plus précieuses de la Terre.\nAbstrak\nHutan tropika adalah di antara ekosistem yang paling produktif dan mempunyai kepelbagaian biodiversiti yang tinggi di seluruh dunia. Walaupun pemahaman mengenai hutan tropika amat penting untuk masa depan kita, usaha-usaha untuk mengkaji dan mengawas hutah-hutan tersebut baru sekarang menjadi lebih diperhubungkan. Perangkaian adalah sangat penting untuk mencari jawapan kepada soalan-soalan yang menjangkaui sempadan dan batasan agensi pendanaan. Di sini kami menunjukkan bagaimana sebuah komuniti global bertindak balas terhadap cabaran penyelidikan ekosistem tropika melalui penglibatan pelbagai kumpulan yang mengukur hutan secara pokok demi pokok dalam beribu-ribu plot jangka panjang. Kami meninjau semula penemuan saintifik utama daripada kerja ini dan menunjukkan bagaimana proses ini sedang mengubah bidang sains hutan tropika. Teras pendekatan kami memberi tumpuan terhadap penghubungan inisiatif akar umbi jangka panjang dengan protokol standar serta pengurusan data untuk mendapatkan hasil skala besar yang kukuh. Dengan menghubungkan penyelidik-penyelidik tropika dan meningkatkan status mereka, model Rangkaian Penyelidikan Sosial kami mengiktiraf kepentingan peranan pengasas data dalam penemuan saintifik. Bermula dengan pengasasan RAINFOR (Amerika Selatan) pada tahun 1999, rangkaian-rangkaian plot kekal kami kemudian disesuaikan untuk Afrika (AfriTRON) dan Asia Tenggara (T-FORCES) dan selanjutnya telah banyak dicontohi di seluruh dunia. Kini, inisiatif-inisiatif tersebut disepadukan melalui infrastruktur siber ForestPlots.net yang menghubungkan rakan sekerja dari 54 negara di 24 buah rangkaian plot. Secara kolektif, rangkaian ini sedang mengubah pemahaman tentang hutan tropika dan peranannya dalam biosfera. Kami telah bekerjasama untuk menemukan bagaimana, di mana dan mengapa karbon serta biodiversiti hutan bertindak balas terhadap perubahan iklim dan juga bagaimana mereka saling bermaklum balas. Kolaborasi pan-tropika jangka panjang ini telah mendedahkan sebuah sinki karbon jangka panjang serta arah alirannya dan juga menjelaskan pemandu-pemandu perubahan yang terpenting, di mana dan bagaimana proses hutan terjejas, masa susul yang ada dan kemungkinan tindakbalas hutan tropika pada perubahan iklim secara berterusan di masa depan. Dengan memanfaatkan pendekatan lama, rangkaian plot sedang menyalakan revolusi yang amat moden dalam sains hutan tropika. Pada masa akan datang, manusia sejagat akan banyak mendapat manfaat jika memupuk komuniti-komuniti akar umbi yang kini berkemampuan secara kolektif menghasilkan pemahaman unik dan jangka panjang mengenai hutan-hutan yang paling berharga di dunia.",
