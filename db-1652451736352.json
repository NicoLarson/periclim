      "abstract": "Logging is widespread in tropical regions, with approximately 50% of all humid tropical forests (1.73 × 109 ha) regarded as production forests. To maintain the ecosystem functions of carbon sequestration and timber supply in tropical production forests over a long term, forest management must be sustainable under changing climate conditions. Individual-based forest models are useful tools to enhance our understanding about the long-term effects of harvest and climate change on forest dynamics because they link empirical field data with simulations of ecological processes. The objective of this study is to analyze the combined effects of selective logging and climate change on biomass stocks and timber harvest in a tropical forest in French Guiana. By applying a forest model, we simulated natural forest dynamics under the baseline scenario of current climate conditions and compared the results with scenarios of selective logging under climate change. The analyses revealed how substantially forest dynamics are altered under different scenarios of climate change. (1) Repeated logging within recovery times decreased biomass and timber harvest, irrespective of the intensity of climate change. (2) With moderate climate change as envisaged by the 5th IPCC Assessment Report (representative concentration pathway 2.6), the average biomass remained the same as in the baseline scenario (−1%), but with intensive climate change (RCP 8.5), the average biomass decreased by 12%. (3) The combination of selective logging and climate change increased the likelihood of changes in forest dynamics, driven mainly by rising temperatures. Under RCP 8.5, the average timber harvest was almost halved, regardless of the logging cycle applied. An application-oriented use of forest models will help to identify opportunities to reduce the effects of unwanted ecosystem changes in a changing environment. To ensure that ecosystem functions in production forests are maintained under climate change conditions, appropriate management strategies will help to maintain biomass and harvest in production forests.",

      "abstract": "The impact of climatic changes that occurred during the last glacial maximum and the Holocene on vegetation changes in the Amazon Basin and the Guiana Shield are still widely debated. The aim of our study was to investigate whether major changes in vegetation (i.e. transitions between rainforests and C4 savannas) occurred in northern French Guiana during the Holocene. We measured variations in the δ13C of soil organic matter at eight sites now occupied by forest or savannah. The forest sites were selected to cover two regions (forest refugia and peneplains) which are thought to have experienced different intensities of disturbance during the latest Pleistocene and the Holocene. We found that none of the forest sites underwent major disturbances during the Holocene, i.e. they were not replaced by C4 savannahs or C4 forest savannahs for long periods. Our results thus suggest that tropical rainforests in northern French Guiana were resilient to drier climatic conditions during the Holocene. Nevertheless, geographical and vertical variations in the 13C of SOM were compatible with minor changes in vegetation, variations in soil processes or in soil physical properties.",

      "abstract": "The contraction of the amount of suitable habitat due to climate change can result in a species becoming threatened with extinction. Strong evidence supports that this effect will be pronounced for several species of small mammals in the near future We address these issues using the ensemble technique to generate potential distribution models for Neotropical marsupials, associated with aquatic environments, Chironectes minimus and Lutreolina crassicaudata, and predict the effects of climate change on the distribution of these two species. We later evaluate the effectiveness of the Integral Protection Areas for the two species in the present and future scenarios. Based on our models, we recommend priority areas for the conservation of these species, emphasizing conservation efforts across borders between countries. Our results indicated that both species will suffer a significant restriction of their potential distributions until 2050. Our models predicted that the loss of suitable areas will be greater for C. minimus, with only ~33% of the original distribution area remaining. The models also indicated that the current system of Fully Protected Areas in the Neotropical region will protect L. crassicaudata in a small area of its current and future potential distribution, inserted in climatically stable areas (~ 14%). These scenarios for these species support strong impacts on the biodiversity protection in aquatic environments in the Neotropical region. We strongly recommend the priority planning and implementation of transboundary Fully Protected Areas in stable areas of distribution of these species to maintain the protection of these marsupials and the ecosystems to which they are associated.",

      "abstract": "Estuarine and coastal areas are often considered as hotspots due to their high diversity and ecological importance. However, communities living on those areas are often submitted to fishery and climate change pressures causing modifications on fish assemblages. French Guiana’s coastal shelf is characterised by warm waters with high turbidity and low salinity caused by the large river discharges from the Amazon and nearby estuaries. The high productivity of these areas supports fisheries and aquaculture activities. However, the structure and dynamics of coastal fish populations in French Guiana have seldom been studied. The aim of this study was to understand the effect of environmental conditions, as well as the influence of the coast and nearby estuaries on the spatio-seasonal variability of demersal fish communities living in shallow coastal waters (less than 20m depth). Data were collected from two fishing campaigns using a multi-filament drifting net during the rainy and dry season at 55 sampling stations along the coast. Results showed a high spatial patchiness and no clear seasonal pattern. Higher abundances and diversities were observed near estuaries where both marine and estuarine species were cohabitating. The high number of rare species and the aggregative behaviour recorded in this study suggest that those communities could be particularly affected by climate change, pollution and overfishing. In the light of increasing pressures expected in this area, new regulations and management programs should be developed to ensure food security and biodiversity conservation.",

      "abstract": "Climate change and biological invasion are major threats to biodiversity, but their combined effects have rarely been quantified. The introduction of congeneric non-native species, in particular, can be especially problematic for native species due to competition and hybridization. Here, we quantify the impacts of climate change on the distribution of an ecologically and economically important native species, Euterpe edulis, and on the invasion potential of its congeneric E. oleracea, across the Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot. We modelled current and future environmental suitability for both species, using a comprehensive set of algorithms and climatic scenarios, and quantified the extent of overlap of their environmentally suitable areas. Climate change reduced environmental suitability for E. edulis, but had neutral effects on E. oleracea. Current and future overlap areas, where competition and hybridization are more likely, were concentrated mostly in the southeastern region of Brazil. Our results suggest that native and non-native congeneric species respond differently to climate change, and that climate change and the introduction of E. oleracea are additional threats to the threatened E. edulis. We recommend avoiding new introductions of E. oleracea especially in the southeastern portion of the Atlantic Forest, and the maintenance of protected areas especially in the southern region.",

      "abstract": "Mangrove wetlands possess four important characteristics as one of the unique marine ecosystems, and are found in the intertidal coastal regions of the tropics and subtropics in the world, mainly between latitudes 25° N and 25° S. The total area of the global mangrove forest is about 1.7 million hectares, spanning over 118 countries and territories. Mangroves play an important ecological role and functioning as a tropical coastal ecosystem with a total net primary productivity as high as 2000 g C·m−2·a−1. Mangrove ecosystems serve a key role in the maintenance and protection for tropical and subtropical marine biodiversity and a very important function in the global biogeochemical processes and climate change. Mangrove wetlands, situated between the terrestrial land and the oceans, are sensitive ecosystems not only to the physical environmental changes also to anthropogenic processes from urbanization and economic development. A rich diversity and communities of flora, fauna, and microorganisms is associated with the mangrove ecosystems and they include both visible organisms and non-visible ones of fungi, bacteria and archaea. These microorganisms play an important ecological role and function in the cycling of nutrients. Mangroves are typical marine ecosystems that are closely associated with the global climate change and can play a positive role. The survival and distribution of mangroves, to serve as an important ecological barrier along the coast, have also been affected by anthropogenic activities and global climate change. The present article reviews the impacts for global climate change on mangroves in terms of global warming, sea-level rising, atmospheric CO2 concentration increasing and extreme weather. It also touches onto the important microbial geochemical processes that are linked to climate change. Archaea are also given attention due to the recent findings on their ubiquity in mangrove and their potential ecological function. The global climate change will bring great challenges and opportunities to research, maintain and development of mangroves in the future.",

It is often assumed that movement will be the dominant response, with populations tracking their climate envelopes in space, but the numerous species restricted to specialized substrates cannot easily move. In warmer regions of the world, such edaphic specialists appear to have accumulated in situ over millions of years, persisting despite climate change by local movements, plastic responses, and genetic adaptation. However, past climates were usually cooler than today and rates of warming slower, while edaphic islands are now exposed to multiple additional threats, including mining.

      "abstract": "French Guiana is a European ultraperipheric region located on the northern Atlantic coast of South America. It constitutes an important forested region for biological conservation in the Neotropics. Although very sparsely populated, with its inhabitants mainly concentrated on the Atlantic coastal strip and along the two main rivers, it is marked by the presence and development of old and new epidemic disease outbreaks, both research and health priorities. In this review paper, we synthetize 15 years of multidisciplinary and integrative research at the interface between wildlife, ecosystem modification, human activities and sociodemographic development, and human health. This study reveals a complex epidemiological landscape marked by important transitional changes, facilitated by increased interconnections between wildlife, land-use change and human occupation and activity, human and trade transportation, demography with substantial immigration, and identified vector and parasite pharmacological resistance. Among other French Guianese characteristics, we demonstrate herein the existence of more complex multi-host disease life cycles than previously described for several disease systems in Central and South America, which clearly indicates that today the greater promiscuity between wildlife and humans due to demographic and economic pressures may offer novel settings for microbes and their hosts to circulate and spread. French Guiana is a microcosm that crystallizes all the current global environmental, demographic and socioeconomic change conditions, which may favor the development of ancient and future infectious diseases.",

      "abstract": "This paper deals with the biological, ecological and economic impact of global warming and mangrove habitat availability on the French Guiana shrimp fishery. A dynamic bio-economic model is built by employing a shrimp stock's growth function depending on Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and on mangrove surface. The model is empirically calibrated for the French Guiana shrimp fishery using time series collected over 1995–2011. First, two Cobb-Douglas functions, which describe shrimp's natural growth and harvest, are estimated. Then, a Maximum Economic Yield (MEY) harvest rule, based on the optimization of the net present value derived from fishing, is computed. Three management strategies are compared (Closure, Status Quo management, and MEY) under three mangrove surface fluctuations and climatic scenarios: (a) SST and mangrove remain stable, (b) SST rises while mangrove declines, (c) SST rises and mangrove remains stable. The scenarios considering a SST rise are based on the median greenhouse gases emission projections estimated by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). The scenario focused on the reduction of mangrove surface is based on a general rate calculated on a global level. Our study shows that preserving the mangrove will increase the resiliency of French Guiana shrimp fishery in the long run.",

      "abstract": "Kerteszia cruzii is a sylvatic mosquito and the primary vector of Plasmodium spp., which can cause malaria in humans in areas outside the Amazon River basin in Brazil. Anthropic changes in the natural environments are the major drivers of massive deforestation and local climate change, with serious impacts on the dynamics of mosquito communities and on the risk of acquiring malaria. Considering the lack of information on the dynamics of malaria transmission in areas across the Atlantic Forest biome, where Ke. cruzii is the dominant vector, and the impact of climate drivers of malaria, the present study aimed to: (i) investigate the occurrence and survival rate of Ke. cruzii based on the distinct vegetation profiles found in areas across the coastal region of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome; (ii) estimate the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) and survival rates of P. vivax and P. falciparum parasites in Ke. cruzii under current and future scenarios. The potential distribution of Plasmodium spp. was estimated using simulation analyses under distinct scenarios of average temperature increases from 1 °C to 3.7 °C. Our results showed that two conditions are necessary to explain the occurrence and survival of Ke. cruzii: warm temperature and presence of the Atlantic Forest biome. Moreover, both Plasmodium species showed a tendency to decrease their EIP and increase their estimated survival rates in a scenario of higher temperature. Our findings support that the high-risk malaria areas may include the southern region of the distribution range of the Atlantic Forest biome in the coming years. Despite its limitations and assumptions, the present study provides robust evidence of areas with potential to be impacted by malaria incidence in a future scenario. These areas should be monitored in the next decades regarding the occurrence of the mosquito vector and the potential for malaria persistence and increased occurrence.",

The first assesses the seasonality and variability of renewable energy resources in LA, as well as their possible complementarities. Variability indices are calculated to assess patterns of wind and solar power resources and a statistical analysis evaluates complementarities between hotspots in the region. The second determines possible impacts on the future long-term wind and solar resource complementarities due to climate change for those regions where complementarity was previously identified. For this, results of two General Circulation Models (GCMs) for two Representative Concentration Pathways - RCPs (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) are used. Results show a higher variability for wind power when compared to solar power generation resources both on an hourly and monthly scales. Results also indicate that Brazil can play an important role regarding renewable energy integration in LA, since the country has the strongest capacity to complement and to be complemented by other LA countries. As for the analysis on climate change impacts, results indicate a strong negative impact on the complementarities in the 2071-2100 period, especially for RCP 8.5.",

      "abstract": "Heliamphora is a genus of carnivorous pitcher plants endemic to the Guiana Highlands with fragmented distributions. We present a well resolved, time-calibrated, and comprehensive Heliamphora phylogeny estimated using Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood based on nuclear genes (26S, ITS, and PHYC) and secondary calibration. We used stochastic mapping to infer ancestral states of morphological characters and ecological traits. Our ancestral state estimations revealed that the pitcher drainage structures characteristic of the genus transformed from a hole to a slit in single clade, while other features (scape pubescence and hammock-like growth) have been gained and lost multiple times. Habitat was similarly labile in Heliamphora, with multiple transitions from the ancestral highland habitats into the lowlands. Using a Mantel test, we found closely related species tend to be geographically closely distributed. Placing our phylogeny in a historical context, major clades likely emerged through both vicariance and dispersal during the Miocene with more recent diversification driven by vertical displacement during the Pleistocene glacial-interglacial thermal oscillations. Despite the dynamic climatic history experienced by Heliamphora, the temperature changes brought by global warming pose a significant threat, particularly for those species at the highest elevations.",

Using limnology theory as a basis, the biogeochemical cycle of carbon in the environment is understood to be the main mechanism for generating reservoir based GHG emissions. A summary of relevant research in South American tropical rain forests and the Canada’s temperate zone, also shows the extent of current systematic analysis of GHG emission research. Proposals are made for more comprehensive data collection from a wider variety of sources and the key problems identified that need to be solved to provide a theoretical basis for future development policies and practice.",

      "abstract": "The scarcity of data on natural history and ecology of lizards still limits the understanding of population dynamics for many species. We attempt to evaluate possible effects of climate change on the population dynamics of three lizard species (Ameiva ameiva, Gonatodes humeralis and Norops fuscoauratus) in two Amazonian localities (Caxiuanã National Forest and Ducke Reserve). We calculated a tolerance index combining environmental thermal adequacy with the b-d model, which consider survival and reproductive rates to calculate population dynamics. Thus, we simulated population growth rates based on current and future environmental operative temperatures, considering an optimistic and a business-as-usual scenario of greenhouse gases emissions (GGE), and evaluate if the sensitivity of life history traits to population growth rate are likely to be trigged by climate change. Our results demonstrated that both populations of G. humeralis and the Ducke population of N. fuscoauratus may become locally extinct under both scenarios of GGE, while both populations of A. ameiva are likely to decrease, but without reaching a scenario of local extirpation. This study represents the first effort to evaluate the sensitivity of lizard populations and elasticity to climate change and demonstrate the geographic variability of these traits in three widespread and habitat-generalist species. We highlight the need of new studies focusing on species with different biological trait patterns, such as endemic distributions and habitat-specialists, to provide the theoretical and empirical basis for biologically informed conservation strategies and actions, in order to minimize the potential extinction of populations due to climate change.",

      "abstract": "We report on the emergence of the epibiotic barnacle Xenobalanus globicipitis in Guiana dolphins (Sotalia guianensis) from Sepetiba Bay, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in September 2018, six months after a lethal morbillivirus epidemic. Small boat surveys were conducted at the entrance and in the interior of the bay from January 2018 to February 2021. Dolphins were photo-identified and classified according to overall spatial use of the Bay. We examined the potential influence of the period and habitat on the prevalence of X. globicipitis. The overall prevalence of the barnacle was 38.7% in 214 dolphins. X. globicipitis was not observed in 99 individually identified dolphins from January to August 2018 (first period) but was seen on 83 of the 194 (42.8%) dolphins photographed from September 2018 to February 2021 (second period). Moreover, in 22 individuals repeatedly photographed during both periods, prevalence was 0% and 91% during the first and second period, respectively. Prevalence was the highest in the dolphins using the entrance of the Bay (55.0%, N = 140), intermediate in animals using equally both the entrance and interior area (42.9%, N = 47), and the lowest (6.4%, N = 7) in those using the interior area only. The calves of five females infested with X. globicipitis were free of barnacles. Based on repeated photographs of barnacles at different growth stage on six dolphins, the periods between first and last sight with the epibiont were (in increasing order) 29, 32, 40, 51, 68 and 78 days. A conservative estimation from the initial settlement to sexual maturity was around 40–45 days. Three individuals of X. globicipitis collected on a stranded dolphin measured 65 mm, 61 mm and 35 mm, the largest recorded size to date. The two large individuals had incubated embryos while the smaller one presented developing gonads. Poor health and an impaired immune response in the dolphins that had survived the morbillivirus epidemic may have favored the introduction of the barnacle, but biotic and abiotic factors could also had played an important role. This paper documents the colonization of an estuarine area by X. globicipitis following ecological changes.",

      "abstract": "Erosion and progradation are natural dynamics that take place across mangrove landscapes, but anthropogenic pressure may disturb these dynamics and cause increased erosion. The increased erosion of mangrove coastlines leads to mangrove degradation and loss of ecosystem services. However, to map the extent of erosion and progradation in dynamic landscapes is often time and data consuming and challenging to perform at a large scale. This study uses cloud computing-based remote sensing analysis in Google Earth Engine to map the extent of mangrove shoreline dynamics in two contrasting hotspots: the Sundarbans mangrove complex across India and Bangladesh, and the coast of French Guiana. Mapping was performed between 1984 and 2018 using available data on mangrove distribution and surface water change, classifying change of states as permanent, seasonal and ephemeral. Between 1984 and 2018, erosion and progradation accounted for 24.55% and 12.52% of total change, respectively. Contrastingly, in French Guiana erosion and progradation accounted for 9.53% and 4.48% of total change, respectively. The Sundarbans experienced more permanent changes as compared to French Guiana. The permanent loss of mangrove forests in the Sundarbans can be attributed to the reduction in sediment supply and the temporary loss in French Guiana to cyclical patterns of migrating mudbanks. The methods presented in this study performed with an overall accuracy above 90% in different settings of both the case studies. This study provides an important baseline of mangrove erosion and progradation extent and an improved method to analyse coastal dynamics in mangrove landscapes.",

      "abstract": "This paper scrutinizes the assertion that knowledge gaps concerning health risks from climate change are unjust, and must be addressed, because they hinder evidence-led interventions to protect vulnerable populations. First, we construct a taxonomy of six inter-related forms of invisibility (social marginalization, forced invisibility by migrants, spatial marginalization, neglected diseases, mental health, uneven climatic monitoring and forecasting) which underlie systematic biases in current understanding of these risks in Latin America, and advocate an approach to climate-health research that draws on intersectionality theory to address these inter-relations. We propose that these invisibilities should be understood as outcomes of structural imbalances in power and resources rather than as haphazard blindspots in scientific and state knowledge. Our thesis, drawing on theories of governmentality, is that context-dependent tensions condition whether or not benefits of making vulnerable populations legible to the state outweigh costs. To be seen is to be politically counted and eligible for rights, yet evidence demonstrates the perils of visibility to disempowered people. For example, flood-relief efforts in remote Amazonia expose marginalized urban river-dwellers to the traumatic prospect of forced relocation and social and economic upheaval. Finally, drawing on research on citizenship in post-colonial settings, we conceptualize climate change as an ‘open moment’ of political rupture, and propose strategies of social accountability, empowerment and trans-disciplinary research which encourage the marginalized to reach out for greater power. These achievements could reduce drawbacks of state legibility and facilitate socially-just governmental action on climate change adaptation that promotes health for all.",

      "abstract": "Malaria is the number one killer among mosquito-transmitted diseases in the world, with a majority of the deaths occurring in African countries. This ancient disease is caused by parasites of the genus Plasmodium and is transmitted by female mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles in a seasonal manner that is dependent on temperature and precipitation. It is especially sensitive to climate change, with researchers predicting that an increase in global temperature of 1.5°C could alter vector habitats and malaria transmission patterns, with a possible increase in malaria-related fatalities. In this chapter, we discuss the origins and prevalence of malaria in the light of earth’s climate history, both paleo and recent, and summarize data derived from various climate models that predict future Anopheles and malaria distribution patterns. We caution that certain criteria must be assessed critically when modeling malaria-climate relationship, especially in the light of increased malaria control, prevention and surveillance measures that have been adopted by WHO countries. Overall, we conclude that there is a strong connection between climate change and malaria, but other factors that affect the spread of the disease including socio-economic development, drug resistance, and immunity, need to be considered to determine future malaria transmission and prevalence rates.",

      "abstract": "Background Tropical forests cover less than 10 per cent of all land area (1.8 × 107 km2) and over half of the tropical-forest area (1.1 × 107 Km2) is represented by humid tropical forests (also called tropical rainforests). The Amazon basin contains the largest rainforest on Earth, almost 5.8 million km2, and occupies about 40% of South America; more than 60% of the basin is located in Brazil and the rest in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela. Over the past decade the positive role of tropical rainforests in capturing large amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) has been demonstrated. In response to the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration, tropical forests act as a global carbon sink. Main body Accumulation of carbon in the tropical terrestrial biosphere strongly contributes to slowing the rate of increase of CO2 into the atmosphere, thus resulting in the reduction of greenhouse gas effect. Tropical rainforests have been estimated to account for 32–36% of terrestrial Net Primary Productivity (NPP) that is the difference between total forest photosynthesis and plant respiration. Tropical rainforests have been acting as a strong carbon sink in this way for decades. However, over the past years, increased concentrations of greenhouse gases, and especially CO2, in the atmosphere have significantly affected the net carbon balance of tropical rainforests, and have warmed the planet substantially driving climate changes through more severe and prolonged heat waves, variability in temperature, increased air pollution, forest fires, droughts, and floods. The role of tropical forests in mitigating climate change is therefore critical. Over the past 30 years almost 600,000 km2 have been deforested in Brazil alone due to the rapid development of Amazonia, this is the reason why currently the region is one of the ‘hotspots’ of global environmental change on the planet. Conclusion Deforestation represents the second largest anthropogenic source of CO2 to the atmosphere, after fossil fuel combustion. There are many causes of deforestation, including socioeconomic and natural factors, such as clear-cutting for agriculture, ranching and development, unsustainable logging for timber, as well as droughts, fires and degradation due to climate change. About natural causes of forest degradation, in the context of the Amazon, the major agent of change in the forest ecosystem would most likely be decreased dry-season precipitation. Of the 23 global climate models employed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in their 2007 report, 50–70% predict a substantial (above 20%) reduction of dry-season rainfall in eastern Amazonia under mid-range greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, 40% in central Amazonia and 20% in the west. While annual carbon emissions from fossil-fuel combustion have been continually increasing since 1960s, historical trends of deforestation and associated carbon emissions have remained poorly understood.",

      "abstract": "The microbial communities inhabiting the Atlantic-East Pacific (AEP) mangroves have been poorly studied, and mostly comprise chronically polluted mangroves. In this study, we characterized changes in the structure and diversity of microbial communities of mangroves along the urban-to-rural gradient of the Cayenne estuary (French Guiana, South America) that experience low human impact. The microbial communities were assigned into 50 phyla. Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Planctomycetes were the most abundant taxa. The environmental determinants found to significantly correlated to the microbial communities at these mangroves were granulometry, dieldrin concentration, pH, and total carbon (TC) content. Furthermore, a precise analysis of the sediment highlights the existence of three types of anthropogenic pressure among the stations: (i) organic matter (OM) enrichment due to the proximity to the city and its wastewater treatment plant, (ii) dieldrin contamination, and (iii) naphthalene contamination. These forms of weak anthropogenic pressure seemed to impact the bacterial population size and microbial assemblages. A decrease in Bathyarchaeota, “Candidatus Nitrosopumilus”, and Nitrospira genera was observed in mangroves subjected to OM enrichment. Mangroves polluted with organic contaminants were enriched in Desulfobacteraceae, Desulfarculaceae, and Acanthopleuribacteraceae (with dieldrin or polychlorobiphenyl contamination), and Chitinophagaceae and Geobacteraceae (with naphthalene contamination). These findings provide insights into the main environmental factors shaping microbial communities of mangroves in the AEP that experience low human impact and allow for the identification of several potential microbial bioindicators of weak anthropogenic pressure.",

      "abstract": "The effects of climate changes on biotic expansion or divergence is a widely debated topic. This discussion is particularly relevant for northern Amazonia where patches of open vegetation environments that harbor high endemic and specialized species are present in a matrix of tall closed canopy forest. This paper presents the depositional chronology and evolution of an 8.7-m thick stabilized fluvial and eolian sediment profile in a sandy plain substrate that underpins the largest open vegetation enclave in northern Amazonia. Three depositional units were identified using optically stimulated luminescence and radiocarbon ages coupled with grain size, magnetic susceptibility, and reflectance analyses. A lower unit of coarse fluvial silt deposited between 53 and 28 ka is overlain unconformably by a 5-m thick middle unit of fine eolian sand deposited at high accumulation rates between the Last Glacial Maximum (23–19 ka) and Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1; 18.1–14.7 ka) when persistent and long-lasting shifts of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) to the Southern Hemisphere promoted dry and windy conditions in northern South America. An upper ~2-m thick unit was deposited when the climate became wetter after HS1, promoting the formation of soils that support open vegetation habitats. This study indicates that abrupt millennial-scale climate events can induce significant changes in the Amazonian landscape, which in turn play an essential role in the distribution and diversification of specialized biota.",

      "abstract": "Granitic outcrop vegetation was compared in 22 inselbergs of French Guiana, South America, using RLQ and fourth-corner analyses to identify the main relationships between environmental gradients and plant traits. At the scale of the whole territory the distribution of species and species traits was mostly driven by a spatially-structured gradient embracing regional climate (annual rainfall), forest matrix (canopy openness), and inselberg features (altitude, shape, habitats, summit forest, degree of epiphytism, fire events). Biogeographic, environmental and past historical factors contribute to explain the variation observed at coarse scale and two groups of inselbergs are identified. A first group occupies the southern peneplain in a semi-open forest matrix and exhibits a higher representation of suffrutescent species and climbers, a lower representation of upright shrubs, a lower degree of Guiana Shield endemism, and a higher incidence of human use and autochory. All these features suggest an adaptation to more disturbed environments linked to past climate changes and savannization and to human influences. A second group, characterized by opposite plant traits, occupies the northern part of French Guiana and the far south within a closed forest matrix. Within archipelagos (inselbergs at less than 7km distance), C-score and Mantel tests revealed a random co-occurrence of plant species and an increase of floristic dissimilarity with distance without any concomitant change in plant traits, respectively, suggesting that spatially-structured stochastic factors (limitation by dispersal) were the driving force of vegetation change at fine scale.",

      "abstract": "This study explores the present day distribution of Lutzomyia longipalpis in relation to climate, and transfers the knowledge gained to likely future climatic conditions to predict changes in the species’ potential distribution. We used ecological niche models calibrated based on occurrences of the species complex from across its known geographic range. Anticipated distributional changes varied by region, from stability to expansion or decline. Overall, models indicated no significant north–south expansion beyond present boundaries. However, some areas suitable both at present and in the future (e.g., Pacific coast of Ecuador and Peru) may offer opportunities for distributional expansion. Our models anticipated potential range expansion in southern Brazil and Argentina, but were variably successful in anticipating specific cases. The most significant climate-related change anticipated in the species’ range was with regard to range continuity in the Amazon Basin, which is likely to increase in coming decades. Rather than making detailed forecasts of actual locations where Lu. longipalpis will appear in coming years, our models make interesting and potentially important predictions of broader-scale distributional tendencies that can inform heath policy and mitigation efforts.",

      "abstract": "Compared to temperate estuaries, tropical ones are less documented. Among them, the numerous estuaries along the Guiana shoreline present at least two original features: they are still preserved from anthropogenic modifications, and their hydro-morphodynamics are influenced by longshore migration of outer coastal mud banks. This study deals with the Maroni estuary, a mesotidal preserved tropical estuary, currently spotting more attention to better anticipate changes related to the development of harbour activities. Field data collected over semi-diurnal tidal cycles in the lower estuary revealed the presence of a turbidity maximum and seasonally contrasted hydro-sedimentary features. A one-year 3D hydrodynamic simulation covering a wide-range of tidal and fluvial conditions was performed to further analyse the seasonal variability of stratification and residual circulation patterns. The estuary is well-mixed for a very low river discharge (lower than 200 m3/s). It becomes partly mixed in both spring and neap tide in case of a moderate river discharge of 700 m3/s. The strongest stratification, which could be associated to a salt wedge near the mouth, appears during neap tides combined with higher discharge. Residual currents along the navigation channel are usually seaward except during neap tides when the discharge is large enough (∼700 m3/s) to generate stratification and landward residual current near the bottom to mid depth until the first km 15 from the mouth. Residual inflow starts from the location of the mud bank and extends along the navigation channel near the eastern bank. The inflow extension matches with observed highly turbid areas and fresh mud deposits, suggesting an outer supply of mud. In summary, this exploratory work allows a first description of current dynamics of the Maroni, and is a first step before a comprehensive study of changes in estuarine circulation and fine sediment transport under different configurations of coastal mud banks.",

      "abstract": "[Our paper documents that land-use change impacts regional and global climate through the surface-energy budget, as well as through the carbon cycle. The surface-energy budget effects may be more important than the carbon-cycle effects. However, land-use impacts on climate cannot be adequately quantified with the usual metric of 'global warming potential'. A new metric is needed to quantify the human disturbance of the Earth's surface-energy budget. This 'regional climate change potential' could offer a new metric for developing a more inclusive climate protocol. This concept would also implicitly provide a mechanism to monitor potential local-scale environmental changes that could influence biodiversity.]",

      "abstract": "[We explore the role of lakes in carbon cycling and global climate, examine the mechanisms influencing carbon pools and transformations in lakes, and discuss how the metabolism of carbon in the inland waters is likely to change in response to climate. Furthermore, we project changes as global climate change in the abundance and spatial distribution of lakes in the biosphere, and we revise the estimate for the global extent of carbon transformation in inland waters. This synthesis demonstrates that the global annual emissions of carbon dioxide from inland waters to the atmosphere are similar in magnitude to the carbon dioxide uptake by the oceans and that the global burial of organic carbon in inland water sediments exceeds organic carbon sequestration on the ocean floor. The role of inland waters in global carbon cycling and climate forcing may be changed by human activities, including construction of impoundments, which accumulate large amounts of carbon in sediments and emit large amounts of methane to the atmosphere. Methane emissions are also expected from lakes on melting permafrost. The synthesis presented here indicates that (1) inland waters constitute a significant component of the global carbon cycle, (2) their contribution to this cycle has significantly changed as a result of human activities, and (3) they will continue to change in response to future climate change causing decreased as well as increased abundance of lakes as well as increases in the number of aquatic impoundments.]",

Fully coupled atmosphere—land surface—lake climate models that could be used for both of these types of study simultaneously do not presently exist, though there are many applications that would benefit from such models. It is argued here that current understanding of physical and biogeochemical processes in freshwater systems is sufficient to begin to construct such models, and a path forward is proposed. The largest impediment to fully representing lakes in the climate system lies in the handling of lakes that are too small to be explicitly resolved by the climate model, and that make up the majority of the lake-covered area at the resolutions currently used by global and regional climate models. Ongoing development within the hydrological sciences community and continual improvements in model resolution should help ameliorate this issue.]",

      "abstract": "[Aim: An understanding of the relationship between forest biomass and climate is needed to predict the impacts of climate change on carbon stores. Biomass patterns have been characterized at geographically or climatically restricted scales, making it unclear if biomass is limited by climate in any general way at continental to global scales. Using a dataset spanning multiple climatic regions we evaluate the generality of published biomass-climate correlations. We also combine metabolic theory and hydraulic limits to plant growth to first derive and then test predictions for how forest biomass should vary with maximum individual tree biomass and the ecosystem water deficit. Location: Temperate forests and dry, moist and wet tropical forests across North, Central and South America. Methods: A forest biomass model was derived from allometric functions and power-law size distributions. Biomass and climate were correlated using extensive forest plot (276 0.1-ha plots), wood density and climate datasets. Climate variables included mean annual temperature, annual precipitation, their ratio, precipitation of the driest quarter, potential and actual evapotranspiration, and the ecosystem water deficit. The water deficit uniquely summarizes water balance by integrating water inputs from precipitation with water losses due to solar energy. Results: Climate generally explained little variation in forest biomass, and mixed support was found for published biomass-climate relationships. Our theory indicated that maximum individual biomass governs forest biomass and is constrained by water deficit. Indeed, forest biomass was tightly coupled to maximum individual biomass and the upper bound of maximum individual biomass declined steeply with water deficit. Water deficit similarly constrained the upper bound of forest biomass, with most forests below the constraint. Main conclusions: The results suggest that: (1) biomass-climate models developed at restricted geographic/climatic scales may not hold at broader scales; (2) maximum individual biomass is strongly related to forest biomass, suggesting that process-based models should focus on maximum individual biomass; (3) the ecosystem water deficit constrains biomass, but realized biomass often falls below the constraint; such that (4) biomass is not strongly limited by climate in most forests so that forest biomass may not predictably respond to changes in mean climate.]",

      "abstract": "[Forest dynamics and tree species composition vary substantially between Paleotropical and Neotropical forests, but these broad biogeographic regions are treated uniformly in many land models. To assess whether these regional differences translate into variation in productivity and carbon (C) storage, we compiled a database of climate, tree stem growth, litterfall, aboveground net primary production (ANPP), and aboveground biomass across tropical rainforest sites spanning 33 countries throughout Central and South America, Asia, and Australasia, but excluding Africa due to a paucity of available data. Though the sum of litterfall and stem growth (ANPP) did not differ between regions, both stem growth and the ratio of stem growth to litterfall were higher in Paleotropical forests compared to Neotropical forests across the full observed range of ANPP. Greater C allocation to woody growth likely explains the much larger aboveground biomass estimates in Paleotropical forests (∼29%, or ∼80 Mg DW/ha, greater than in the Neotropics). Climate was similar in Paleo- and Neotropical forests, thus the observed differences in C likely reflect differences in the evolutionary history of species and forest structure and function between regions. Our analysis suggests that Paleotropical forests, which can be dominated by tall-statured Dipterocarpaceae species, may be disproportionate hotspots for aboveground C storage. Land models typically treat these distinct tropical forests with differential structures as a single functional unit, but our findings suggest that this may overlook critical biogeographic variation in C storage potential among regions.]",

      "abstract": "[We have taken an important first step in validating climate models by comparing model and satellite inferred clear sky TOA (top-of-atmosphere) albedos. Model albedos were computed on a 1° × 1° latitude-longitude grid, allowing for variations in surface vegetation type, solar zenith angle, orography, spectral absorption/scattering at surface and within the atmosphere. Observed albedos were inferred from GOES-2 minimum narrowband (0.55–0.75 μm) brightness for November 1978 over South America and most of North America and adjacent ocean regions. Comparisons of TOA albedos over ocean agree within ±1% (the unit for albedo is in percent and the differences in percent denote absolute differences), and thus lie within both theoretical uncertainties (due to water vapor and aerosol concentrations, and ocean surface spectral reflectivity), as well as observational uncertainties. The ocean comparisons also show significant latitudinal variations in both model and observations. Albedos over land mostly agree within ±2% for the entire range of significant geographical variation of albedo from 13% over the Amazon Basin to 24% over mountains of western North America. These agreements lie within both theoretical uncertainties (due to surface type and spectral/zenith angle dependencies), as well as observational uncertainties (due to spectral and angular conversions of observed brightness to broadband albedos).]",

      "abstract": "Increasing the share of renewable energy sources in power systems is key to a successful energy transition. Optimal renewable site selection requires a holistic approach, involving land, resources, environmental and economical data and constraints. In this paper we consider the problem of solar PV penetration into the power network as a spatiotemporal analysis combined with decision support targeted for policy makers and investors. Our goal is to seek new models that maximize energy penetration and stability into the network, while minimizing the operational costs. We show how the selection of solar PV sites can be accomplished to satisfy such objectives by investigating the optimal clustering of multiple solar PV parks around a shared electrical substation. This is a combinatorial problem in terms of all the potential clusters given the set of PV site candidates. Our main contribution lies in identifying and proposing a modeling analogy of our problem with the so-called SONET problem, tackled in fiber network designs. We show how this new spatiotemporal PV park placement model minimizes operational costs, while increasing energy stability of the solutions produced. We also introduce a GIS preprocessing step to reduce the computational cost of the proposed approach. We compare our proposed SONET-based model to an existing GIS-optimization model on a real case study and data from the French Guiana’s power system. This new approach aggregates multiple PV parks into clusters distributed across the territory. In the case of French Guiana, the same global nominal power (≈45MW) can, for instance, be distributed among 11 PV parks and 3 clusters, against 3 large-scale PV parks. Results show substantial gain in costs per kWh produced, up to 10MW of extra installed power and 16GWh of extra power generation when considering PV parks ⩽5MW. The new cluster configuration also ensures improved energy stability of the solutions, resulting in mitigation of the risks for both the network manager and the decision maker.",

      "abstract": "Tropical forests have a complex structure, from lowlands to mountain forests, and among them is the heath forest (HF). HF are characterized by nutrient poor soil which limits all above ground biomass, in addition to the forest structure and biodiversity. HF are distributed in Southeast Asia as well as in the Neotropics, although they are known by different names. Their distribution is in patches in lowland sites. Trees with poor economic value have resulted in a poor consideration of the forest from a conservation perspective. In this study, we emphasize the reconsideration of the HF when it comes to its importance in term of species diversity, endemism, and ecosystem services at both the global and regional level. Moreover, HF has a crucial role in public education, tourism, and the local economy, and as a buffer in terms of limiting the climate change effect on many tropical cities.",

      "abstract": "The scarcity of data on natural history and ecology of lizards still limits the understanding of population dynamics for many species. We attempt to evaluate possible effects of climate change on the population dynamics of three lizard species (Ameiva ameiva, Gonatodes humeralis and Norops fuscoauratus) in two Amazonian localities (Caxiuanã National Forest and Ducke Reserve). We calculated a tolerance index combining environmental thermal adequacy with the b-d model, which consider survival and reproductive rates to calculate population dynamics. Thus, we simulated population growth rates based on current and future environmental operative temperatures, considering an optimistic and a business-as-usual scenario of greenhouse gases emissions (GGE), and evaluate if the sensitivity of life history traits to population growth rate are likely to be trigged by climate change. Our results demonstrated that both populations of G. humeralis and the Ducke population of N. fuscoauratus may become locally extinct under both scenarios of GGE, while both populations of A. ameiva are likely to decrease, but without reaching a scenario of local extirpation. This study represents the first effort to evaluate the sensitivity of lizard populations and elasticity to climate change and demonstrate the geographic variability of these traits in three widespread and habitat-generalist species. We highlight the need of new studies focusing on species with different biological trait patterns, such as endemic distributions and habitat-specialists, to provide the theoretical and empirical basis for biologically informed conservation strategies and actions, in order to minimize the potential extinction of populations due to climate change.",

      "abstract": "This study explores the present day distribution of Lutzomyia longipalpis in relation to climate, and transfers the knowledge gained to likely future climatic conditions to predict changes in the species’ potential distribution. We used ecological niche models calibrated based on occurrences of the species complex from across its known geographic range. Anticipated distributional changes varied by region, from stability to expansion or decline. Overall, models indicated no significant north–south expansion beyond present boundaries. However, some areas suitable both at present and in the future (e.g., Pacific coast of Ecuador and Peru) may offer opportunities for distributional expansion. Our models anticipated potential range expansion in southern Brazil and Argentina, but were variably successful in anticipating specific cases. The most significant climate-related change anticipated in the species’ range was with regard to range continuity in the Amazon Basin, which is likely to increase in coming decades. Rather than making detailed forecasts of actual locations where Lu. longipalpis will appear in coming years, our models make interesting and potentially important predictions of broader-scale distributional tendencies that can inform heath policy and mitigation efforts.",

      "abstract": "Scenarios help build a shared understanding of potential futures and allow us to engage with how interventions or activities may impact on people and the environment. There are many scenario sets that have been developed at the global and regional level, but to a lesser extent at the national and local levels. Yet fewer studies have explicitly linked imagined futures at different social–ecological scales. In this paper, we discuss how scenario analysis was used with indigenous communities and national level stakeholders in Guyana, South America, to explore context specific futures in relation to linked social-ecological systems. These futures were then analysed against published regional (Amazonian) and international scenarios using a qualitative coding approach and supported by quantitative factorial analysis. This allowed us to develop a matrix of multi-scalar scenarios, showing how scenarios at all scales interact. From this, we were able to identify virtuous and vicious cycles amongst the different scales where developments produced feedbacks to make situations worse, better or counteract change at other levels. Our results show that there is considerable mismatch between the different scales of analysis, with the national scale playing a key role as mediator. In addition, we highlight the importance of focusing on the root causes shaping futures as well as participatory forms of scenario development in order to provide better policy and decision support, and stimulate engagement at all levels of organisation in the process of change.",

      "abstract": "Ethnopharmacological relevance Quassia amara L. recently came into the spotlight in French Guiana, when it became the object of a biopiracy claim. Due to the numerous use records throughout the Guiana shield, at least since the 18th century, a thorough investigation of its origin seemed relevant and timely. In the light of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) and the Nagoya protocol, questions about the origin of local knowledge are important to debate. Aim of the study: Defining cultural biogeography as the dynamics through space and time of biocultural complexes, we used this theoretical framework to shed light on the complex biogeographical and cultural history of Q. amara. We explored in particular the possible transfer of medicinal knowledge on an Old World species to a botanically related New World one by enslaved Africans in Suriname. Materials and methods Historical and contemporary literature research was performed by means of digitized manuscripts, archives and databases from the 17th to the 21st century. We retrieved data from digitized herbarium vouchers in herbaria of the Botanic Garden Meise (Belgium); Naturalis Biodiversity Center (the Netherlands); Missouri Botanical Garden, the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, the Field Museum (USA); Royal Botanic Gardens Kew (UK); the IRD Herbarium, French Guiana and the Museum National d’Histoire Naturelle (France). Vernacular names were retrieved from literature and herbarium specimens and compared to verify the origin of Quassia amara and its uses. Results Our exploration of digitized herbarium vouchers resulted in 1287 records, of which 661 were Q. amara and 636 were Q. africana. We observed that the destiny of this species, over at least 300 years, interweaves politics, economy, culture and medicine in a very complex way. Quassia amara's uses are difficult to attribute to specific cultural groups: the species is widely distributed in Central and South America, where it is popular among many ethnic groups. The species spread from Central to South America during the early 18th century due to political and economic reasons. This migration possibly resulted from simultaneous migration by religious orders (Jesuits) from Central America to northern South America and by Carib-speaking Amerindians (from northern South America to Suriname). Subsequently, through colonial trade networks, Q. amara spread to the rest of the world. The absence of African-derived local names in the Guiana shield suggests that Q. africana was not sufficiently familiar to enslaved Africans in the region that they preserved its names and transferred the associated medicinal knowledge to Q. amara. Conclusions Cultural biogeography has proven an interesting concept to reconstruct the dynamics of biocultural interactions through space and time, while herbarium databases have shown to be useful to decipher evolution of local plant knowledge. Tracing the origin of a knowledge is nevertheless a complex adventure that deserves time and interdisciplinary studies.",

      "abstract": "This review assesses the degree of resilience of mangrove forests to large, infrequent disturbance (tsunamis) and their role in coastal protection, and to chronic disturbance events (climate change) and the future of mangroves in the face of global change. From a geological perspective, mangroves come and go at considerable speed with the current distribution of forests a legacy of the Holocene, having undergone almost chronic disturbance as a result of fluctuations in sea-level. Mangroves have demonstrated considerable resilience over timescales commensurate with shoreline evolution. This notion is supported by evidence that soil accretion rates in mangrove forests are currently keeping pace with mean sea-level rise. Further support for their resilience comes from patterns of recovery from natural disturbances (storms, hurricanes) which coupled with key life history traits, suggest pioneer-phase characteristics. Stand composition and forest structure are the result of a complex interplay of physiological tolerances and competitive interactions leading to a mosaic of interrupted or arrested succession sequences, in response to physical/chemical gradients and landform changes. The extent to which some or all of these factors come into play depends on the frequency, intensity, size, and duration of the disturbance. Mangroves may in certain circumstances offer limited protection from tsunamis; some models using realistic forest variables suggest significant reduction in tsunami wave flow pressure for forests at least 100 m in width. The magnitude of energy absorption strongly depends on tree density, stem and root diameter, shore slope, bathymetry, spectral characteristics of incident waves, and tidal stage upon entering the forest. The ultimate disturbance, climate change, may lead to a maximum global loss of 10–15% of mangrove forest, but must be considered of secondary importance compared with current average annual rates of 1–2% deforestation. A large reservoir of below-ground nutrients, rapid rates of nutrient flux and microbial decomposition, complex and highly efficient biotic controls, self-design and redundancy of keystone species, and numerous feedbacks, all contribute to mangrove resilience to various types of disturbance.",

      "abstract": "Erosion and progradation are natural dynamics that take place across mangrove landscapes, but anthropogenic pressure may disturb these dynamics and cause increased erosion. The increased erosion of mangrove coastlines leads to mangrove degradation and loss of ecosystem services. However, to map the extent of erosion and progradation in dynamic landscapes is often time and data consuming and challenging to perform at a large scale. This study uses cloud computing-based remote sensing analysis in Google Earth Engine to map the extent of mangrove shoreline dynamics in two contrasting hotspots: the Sundarbans mangrove complex across India and Bangladesh, and the coast of French Guiana. Mapping was performed between 1984 and 2018 using available data on mangrove distribution and surface water change, classifying change of states as permanent, seasonal and ephemeral. Between 1984 and 2018, erosion and progradation accounted for 24.55% and 12.52% of total change, respectively. Contrastingly, in French Guiana erosion and progradation accounted for 9.53% and 4.48% of total change, respectively. The Sundarbans experienced more permanent changes as compared to French Guiana. The permanent loss of mangrove forests in the Sundarbans can be attributed to the reduction in sediment supply and the temporary loss in French Guiana to cyclical patterns of migrating mudbanks. The methods presented in this study performed with an overall accuracy above 90% in different settings of both the case studies. This study provides an important baseline of mangrove erosion and progradation extent and an improved method to analyse coastal dynamics in mangrove landscapes.",

      "abstract": "Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) is the most prevalent form of Leishmaniasis and is widely endemic in the Americas. Several species of Leishmania are responsible for CL, a severely neglected tropical disease and the treatment of CL vary according to the different species of Leishmania. We proposed to map the distribution of the Leishmania species reported in French Guiana (FG) using a biogeographic approach based on environmental predictors. We also measured species endemism i.e., the uniqueness of species to a defined geographic location. Our results show that the distribution patterns varied between Leishmania spp. and were spatially dependent on climatic covariates. The species distribution modelling of the eco-epidemiological spatial patterns of Leishmania spp. is the first to measure endemism based on bioclimatic factors in FG. The study also emphasizes the impact of tree cover loss and climate on the increasing distribution of L. (Viannia) braziliensis in the most anthropized regions. Detection of high-risk regions for the different between Leishmania spp. is essential for monitoring and active surveillance of the vector. As climate plays a major role in the spatial distribution of the vector and reservoir and the survival of the pathogen, climatic covariates should be included in the analysis and mapping of vector-borne diseases. This study underscores the significance of local land management and the urgency of considering the impact of climate change in the development of vector-borne disease management strategies at the global scale.",

Illegal deforestation and the setting of fires, expanding soy and beef agribusiness, and rapid shifts in the South American and global geopolitical landscape, coupled with a weakening of environmental governance, threaten the vitality of Indigenous Protected Areas (IPAs) and Protected Natural Areas (PNAs), perhaps the most important bulwarks against the destruction of the Amazon [1,2••,3–6] (Butler 2020; Lovejoy and Nobre 2018; Lovejoy and Nobre, 2019; Butler 2019; Walker et al., 2020; Sheil et al., 2015).

      "abstract": "Estuarine and coastal areas are often considered as hotspots due to their high diversity and ecological importance. However, communities living on those areas are often submitted to fishery and climate change pressures causing modifications on fish assemblages. French Guiana’s coastal shelf is characterised by warm waters with high turbidity and low salinity caused by the large river discharges from the Amazon and nearby estuaries. The high productivity of these areas supports fisheries and aquaculture activities. However, the structure and dynamics of coastal fish populations in French Guiana have seldom been studied. The aim of this study was to understand the effect of environmental conditions, as well as the influence of the coast and nearby estuaries on the spatio-seasonal variability of demersal fish communities living in shallow coastal waters (less than 20m depth). Data were collected from two fishing campaigns using a multi-filament drifting net during the rainy and dry season at 55 sampling stations along the coast. Results showed a high spatial patchiness and no clear seasonal pattern. Higher abundances and diversities were observed near estuaries where both marine and estuarine species were cohabitating. The high number of rare species and the aggregative behaviour recorded in this study suggest that those communities could be particularly affected by climate change, pollution and overfishing. In the light of increasing pressures expected in this area, new regulations and management programs should be developed to ensure food security and biodiversity conservation.",

      "abstract": "Phytolith reference collections are a fundamental prerequisite for accurate interpretation of fossil phytolith assemblages used in reconstructing vegetation histories. As part of a multi-disciplinary research project studying Late Holocene landscape transformations associated with pre-Columbian raised field complexes in the coastal savannas of French Guiana, phytolith production in selected plant species with high environmental and economic significance native to the region was examined. A total of 49 families, 92 genera, and 108 species were analysed. Phytolith abundance in each specimen was rated qualitatively and morphotypes described following modern standards of nomenclature. Of the 92 non-Poaceae species tested, 37 contributed phytoliths that are diagnostic to at least the family level. Two of these are newly-discovered phytolith morphotypes isolated from Protium guianense (Burseraceae) and Thelypteris confluens (Thelypteridaceae [Pteridophyta]) which have not been described previously. This work represents the first systematic undertaking to establish a phytolith reference collection of French Guiana flora. Results reinforce the usefulness of phytolith analysis for distinguishing ecologically significant taxa, and therefore major vegetation formations. The creation of a comprehensive reference collection for French Guiana improves taxonomic resolution and has provided the necessary ground work for the interpretation of palaeoevironmental and archaeological records in the region.",

Here, contourite deposits have been studied in detail, following the recent discovery of contourite sequences likely related to the bottom currents and linked both to contour current and peculiar sea-floor morphology. A chronostratigraphic framework, based on δ18O relative variations and palaeomagnetic events in sediment cores allows correlating sediment processes to current intensity changes and major climate phases (glacial or interglacial). The studied sediments are enriched in glauconitic grains. In addition, the glauconite mineralogical maturity can easily correlate to low sedimentation rate and slightly energetic bottom currents on the seafloor. Based on these data and using the glauconitic authigenic mineral as proxy for inferring the degree of winnowing at the sediment-water interface, we might put forward the hypothesis that the intensity of NADW is higher during the glacial stages and lower during interglacial periods.",

      "abstract": "Mangrove-fringed coasts are a major coastal environment in the tropics that exchange enormous quantities of inorganic and organic materials and dissolved ions with the adjacent ocean in unique ways. The 1,600 km long Guiana coast, from the Amazon River mouth to the Orinoco, the world's most extensive example, is exposed to significant oceanic wave and tidal energy but is almost exclusively composed of mud deposits. The huge alluvial discharge of the Amazon advected along the inner continental shelf is reworked into 20–25 shore-attached and mobile mud-banks 10–40 km in length. Frequent and deep resuspension created by the energetic conditions results in fluid mud suspensions (10–400 g 1−1) that dewater upon re-deposition, resulting in extreme shoreline progradation rates (up to hundreds of metres per year) that are equally rapidly mobilized by wave attack. Biological assemblages (mangroves, foraminifera, diatoms, etc.) and biogeochemical conditions are strongly controlled by the intense recycling of sediments on the shoreface. Differences in sedimentary, ecological and biogeochemical processes are striking when this coast is compared with mangrove-fringed deltaic and estuarine coasts elsewhere, including those of west Africa and southeast Asia.",

      "abstract": "Zika virus (ZIKV) may cause severe microcephaly in newborn babies and Guillain-Barré syndrome in some adults. In recent decades, its range has expanded in 86 countries. There are two ecologically and evolutionarily district cycles: urban cycle and sylvatic cycle. This work aimed to estimate the urban and sylvatic cycle areas of ZIKV throughout the world. The occurrence records of vectors, non-human primate hosts, and ZIKV were collected. We chose historical climate data, predicted vectors distribution, human population density, and elevation data as the variables to fit the maximum entropy model (MaxEnt). Current risk area and future prediction were performed with global climate models (GCMs) and shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). Predicting the ZIKV risk area would help tailor related control strategies. The results indicated that 16.6% of the world’s landmass (except Antarctica) is a risk area in the urban cycle. Approximately 6.22 billion people (78.69% of the global population) live in the risk area, with the vast majority in South Asia, tropical Africa, South America, North America, and countries around the Mediterranean Sea. Future climate change decreases the risk area of ZIKV. This study also suggested that the sylvatic cycle happened between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn. The overlap region of the urban and sylvatic cycles could be hotpots that ZIKV spill from the sylvatic to the urban cycle. It is indicated that long-term passenger screening, mosquito surveillance, and control are necessary.",

      "abstract": "Projections of climate change show some regions of the world getting warmer, colder, dryer or wetter. Consequently, the effects of climate change on insect pests can alter the threat to agricultural systems. As a result of changed climate, areas can become more or less suitable for insect pests. Neoleucinodes elegantalis is one of the major pests of solanaceous crops in South America. Host plants for N. elegantalis are widely present in South America, however, N. elegantalis is absent from many regions in South America. Hence, future climate effects on suitability for development and spread of N. elegantalis in South America should be investigated. Due to these reasons, we developed a model of the climate for N. elegantalis using CLIMEX software for South America using A2 Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) for 2030, 2050, 2070 and 2100 and using two models, CSIRO-Mk3.0 and MIROC-H. The results of both models indicate that areas in South America that are climatically suitable at the present time will become climatically unsuitable for N. elegantalis by 2100 as a consequence of progressive increase of dry stress. This was confirmed using developmental bioassays, where survival was lowest at low relative humidity levels. There are also altering areas that are currently unsuitable that become suitable in the future. These results are helpful in developing future strategies to take advantage of new opportunities in solanaceous crops in regions that may be unsuitable for N. elegantalis and provide important information for anticipated possible risks of infestation of N. elegantalis.",

      "abstract": "Black mangroves (Avicennia spp.) are hypothesized to expand their latitudinal range with global climate change in the 21st century, induced by a reduction in the frequency and severity of coastal freezes, which are known to limit mangrove colony extent and individual tree size. The Gulf of Mexico is a prime candidate for population expansion to occur because it is located at the northward limit of black mangrove habitat. This may come at the expense of existing coastal saline wetlands that are dominantly Spartina spp. marsh grasses. The present study was conducted to focus on the implications of a marsh to mangrove transition in Gulf wetlands, specifically: (1) wetland resistance to accelerating eustatic sea level rise (ESLR) rates; (2) resistance to wave attack in large storms (increased cyclonic storm frequency/intensity is predicted with future climate warming); and (3) organic carbon sequestration and wetland soil geochemistry. Field sites of adjacent and inter-grown Avicennia germinans mangrove and Spartina marsh populations in similar geomorphological setting were selected in back-barrier areas near Port Aransas and Galveston, TX. Elevation surveys in the more mature Port Aransas site indicate mangrove vegetated areas are 4 cm higher in elevation than surrounding marsh on an average regional scale, and 1–2 cm higher at the individual mangrove scale. 210Pb and 137Cs accumulation rates and loss on ignition data indicate that mineral trapping is 4.1 times higher and sediment organics are 1.7 times lower in mangroves at Port Aransas. This additional mineral trapping does not differ in grain size character from marsh accumulation. Elevation change may also be effected by soil displacement of higher root volumes in mangrove cores. Port Aransas porosities are lower in mangrove rooted horizons, with a corresponding increase in sediment strength, suggesting mangrove intervals are more resistant to wave-induced erosion during storm events. Port Aransas mangroves exhibit higher pore water redox potentials and salinities over entire core depths and depressed pH over rooted intervals, suggesting a distinct diagenetic environment exists relative to marsh sites. The rooting network, which introduces oxygen into the sediment and focuses evapo-transpiration and salt exclusion within this zone, may prove advantageous when competing with grasses by elevating salinities to levels that are toxic for Spartina. Trends observed in the more mature systems of Port Aransas are generally absent in Galveston, suggesting the youth and physically shorter stature of these systems means they have not yet established a unique sediment signature.",

      "abstract": "Selective logging in tropical forests is often perceived as a source of forest degradation and carbon emissions. Improved practices, such as reduced-impact logging (RIL), and alternative timber production strategies (e.g. plantations) can drastically change the overall carbon impact of the wood production sector. Assessing the carbon balance of timber production is crucial but highly dependent on methodological approaches, especially regarding system boundaries and temporality. We developed a temporally-explicit and territory scale model of carbon balance calibrated with long-term local data using Bayesian inference. The model accounts for carbon fluxes from selective logging in natural forest, timber plantation, first transformation and avoided emissions through energy substitution. We used it to compare prospective scenarios of development for the wood sector in French Guiana. Results show that intensification of practices, through increased logging intensity conducted with RIL and establishment of timber plantations, are promising development strategies to reduce the carbon emissions of the French-Guianese wood sector, as well as the area needed for wood production and hence the pressure on natural forests. By reducing logging damage by nearly 50%, RIL allows increasing logging intensity in natural forest from 20 m3 ha−1 to 30 m3 ha−1 without affecting the carbon balance. The use of logging byproducts as fuelwood also improved the carbon balance of selective logging, when substituted to fossil fuel. Allocating less than 30000 ha to plantation would allow producing 200000 m3 of timber annually, while the same production in natural forest would imply logging more than 400000 ha over 60 years. Timber plantation should be preferentially established on non-forested lands, as converting natural forests to plantation leads to high carbon emission peak over the first three decades. We recommend a mixed-strategy combining selective logging in natural forests and plantations as a way to improve long-term carbon balance while reducing short-term emissions. This strategy can reduce the pressure on natural forests while mitigating the risks of changing practices and allowing a diversified source of timber for a diversity of uses. It requires adaptation of the wood sector and development of technical guidelines. Research and monitoring efforts are also needed to assess the impacts of changing practices on other ecosystem services, especially biodiversity conservation.",

      "abstract": "Today, the overall goal of energy transition planning is to seek an optimal strategy for increasing the share of renewable sources in existing power networks, such that the growing power demand is satisfied at manageable short/long term investment. In this paper we address the problem of PV penetration in electricity networks, by considering both (1) the spatial issue of site selection and size, and (2) the temporal aspect of hourly load and demand satisfaction, in addition with the investment and maintenance costs to guarantee a viable and reliable solution. We propose to address this spatio-temporal optimization problem through an integrated GIS and robust optimization model, that allows handling of the ubiquitous dependencies between resource and demand time variability and the selection of optimal sites of renewable power generation. Our approach contributes to the integration of the multi-dimensional and combinatorial aspects of this problem, gathering geographical layers (regional or national scale) and temporal packing (hourly time stamp) constraints, and cost functions. This model computes the optimal geographical location and size of PV facilities allowing energy planning targets to be met at minimal cost in a reliable manner. In this paper, we illustrate our approach by studying the penetration of large-scale solar PV in the French Guiana’s power system. Among the results, we show for instance that: (1) our approach performs geographical aggregation with real contextual data, i.e. balances the intermittency of RE sources by spreading out the corresponding installations (location + size) across the territory; (2) the total installed PV capacity can be doubled by removing the 35% penetration limit on intermittent power without exceeding hourly demand; (3) the safest investment scenario is below 30MW of new PV facilities (≈45M€ and 2 plants), though it is theoretically possible to install up to 45MW (>120M€ and 11 plants).",

      "abstract": "Logging is widespread in tropical regions, with approximately 50% of all humid tropical forests (1.73 × 109 ha) regarded as production forests. To maintain the ecosystem functions of carbon sequestration and timber supply in tropical production forests over a long term, forest management must be sustainable under changing climate conditions. Individual-based forest models are useful tools to enhance our understanding about the long-term effects of harvest and climate change on forest dynamics because they link empirical field data with simulations of ecological processes. The objective of this study is to analyze the combined effects of selective logging and climate change on biomass stocks and timber harvest in a tropical forest in French Guiana. By applying a forest model, we simulated natural forest dynamics under the baseline scenario of current climate conditions and compared the results with scenarios of selective logging under climate change. The analyses revealed how substantially forest dynamics are altered under different scenarios of climate change. (1) Repeated logging within recovery times decreased biomass and timber harvest, irrespective of the intensity of climate change. (2) With moderate climate change as envisaged by the 5th IPCC Assessment Report (representative concentration pathway 2.6), the average biomass remained the same as in the baseline scenario (−1%), but with intensive climate change (RCP 8.5), the average biomass decreased by 12%. (3) The combination of selective logging and climate change increased the likelihood of changes in forest dynamics, driven mainly by rising temperatures. Under RCP 8.5, the average timber harvest was almost halved, regardless of the logging cycle applied. An application-oriented use of forest models will help to identify opportunities to reduce the effects of unwanted ecosystem changes in a changing environment. To ensure that ecosystem functions in production forests are maintained under climate change conditions, appropriate management strategies will help to maintain biomass and harvest in production forests.",

      "abstract": "Malaria is the number one killer among mosquito-transmitted diseases in the world, with a majority of the deaths occurring in African countries. This ancient disease is caused by parasites of the genus Plasmodium and is transmitted by female mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles in a seasonal manner that is dependent on temperature and precipitation. It is especially sensitive to climate change, with researchers predicting that an increase in global temperature of 1.5°C could alter vector habitats and malaria transmission patterns, with a possible increase in malaria-related fatalities. In this chapter, we discuss the origins and prevalence of malaria in the light of earth’s climate history, both paleo and recent, and summarize data derived from various climate models that predict future Anopheles and malaria distribution patterns. We caution that certain criteria must be assessed critically when modeling malaria-climate relationship, especially in the light of increased malaria control, prevention and surveillance measures that have been adopted by WHO countries. Overall, we conclude that there is a strong connection between climate change and malaria, but other factors that affect the spread of the disease including socio-economic development, drug resistance, and immunity, need to be considered to determine future malaria transmission and prevalence rates.",

Sediment core GeoB16224-1 (ca. 7°N), raised from a site in the continental slope off French Guiana in western equatorial Atlantic under the influence of the Amazon River discharge, documents the impacts of H and DO stadials on both inorganic (i.e., Fe/Ca record) and organic (i.e., alkenone C37 concentration and C37/C38 ratio) geochemistry between 41 and 13 ka BP. Our results show millennial-scale covariations of increased Fe/Ca values with decreased C37 concentration and C37/C38 ratios during H and DO stadials. Comparing our high temporal resolution data with previously published records from ca. 17°N to 4°S, we are able to differentiate the influence of H and DO stadials upon tropical South American precipitation. We find that records under the influence of the South American summer monsoon (e.g., western Amazon) and the northern edge of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) (e.g., northernmost South America) exhibit strong climate shifts during both H and DO stadials, but regions under the influence of the southern edge of the ITCZ (e.g., northeastern Brazil) experience a weaker reaction during DO stadials than during H stadials.",

      "abstract": "Fog is a crucial driver of epiphyte richness in tropical montane cloud forests but its spatial occurrence and role in tropical lowland areas is poorly understood. Recent studies in French Guiana have reported high epiphyte richness in previously undescribed “tropical lowland cloud forest” (LCF) due to radiation fog. Here, we analyze the spatial extent of fog/low stratus (FLS) in lowland forests of French Guiana using the frequency distribution by means of night-time MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) satellite data for the years 2007–2010. The analysis is based on a newly developed dynamic threshold-test method relying on brightness temperature differences between thermal and mid-infrared bands. Individual thresholds for the discrimination between fog/low stratus and cloud-free pixels were retrieved by radiative transfer calculations and validated using discriminant analysis. The thresholds dynamically depend on total precipitable water (TPW) and the terrain-induced maximum possible sub-pixel fog coverage. The results of the new retrieval were validated using in-situ data and compared to results from existing fog detection algorithms, showing an improvement of the new detection scheme regarding the capability to detect sub-pixel fog coverage under varying TPW. FLS frequency maps derived from the novel fog classification scheme indicate a widespread distribution of night-time fog in river valleys, marking a multitude of potential areas for LCF throughout French Guiana. LCF is probably not only a local phenomenon but also may be widely distributed in river valleys in the lowland tropics, with significant consequences for biodiversity mapping in tropical lowland areas.",

      "abstract": "In marine turtles, the physical conditions experienced by eggs during incubation affect embryonic development. In the leatherback, hatching success is known to be low in relation to other marine turtles as a result of high embryonic mortality. Moreover, the hatching success on Yalimapo in French Guiana, one major nesting beach for this species, is lower compared to other nesting sites. We assessed the rate of leatherback turtle embryonic mortality in order to investigate the tolerance of leatherback turtle clutches laid on Yalimapo beach to tidal overwash, and we highlight causes of poor hatching success. Of the 89 nests studied, 27 were overlapped by tide at least once during the incubation period (of which five nests were lost by erosion). The hatching success was on average significantly lower in overwashed nests than in non-overwashed, highlighting the existence of embryonic developmental arrest linked to tidal inundation. The stages of developmental arrest and their proportion are linked with time, frequency and level of overwash events. In the context of global warming and associated sea-level rise, understanding the detrimental effect of tidal inundation on the development of marine turtle nests is of interest in nesting sites where turtles are likely to be forced to nest closer to the tide line, thus exposing their nests to greater risk of nest overlap with sea and tidal inundation.",

      "abstract": "Climate change and biological invasion are major threats to biodiversity, but their combined effects have rarely been quantified. The introduction of congeneric non-native species, in particular, can be especially problematic for native species due to competition and hybridization. Here, we quantify the impacts of climate change on the distribution of an ecologically and economically important native species, Euterpe edulis, and on the invasion potential of its congeneric E. oleracea, across the Atlantic Forest biodiversity hotspot. We modelled current and future environmental suitability for both species, using a comprehensive set of algorithms and climatic scenarios, and quantified the extent of overlap of their environmentally suitable areas. Climate change reduced environmental suitability for E. edulis, but had neutral effects on E. oleracea. Current and future overlap areas, where competition and hybridization are more likely, were concentrated mostly in the southeastern region of Brazil. Our results suggest that native and non-native congeneric species respond differently to climate change, and that climate change and the introduction of E. oleracea are additional threats to the threatened E. edulis. We recommend avoiding new introductions of E. oleracea especially in the southeastern portion of the Atlantic Forest, and the maintenance of protected areas especially in the southern region.",

      "abstract": "This study entailed a review of 80 scientific articles on different environmental issues and challenges confronting the rivers, streams and running water in South America. The diversity of issues identified in the review is categorised based on themes that were widely addressed in the studies. Six themes of these are grouped into the following categories: pollution; contamination; climate changes, global warming and/or drought; anthropogenic/human impacts, urbanisation, land use; sedimentation and flooding. Pollution and contamination are the most environmental issues addressed by most of the research work reviewed in this study. These are followed by the impacts of climate vulnerabilities and anthropogenic activities, sedimentation and flooding respectively. These issues transcend one single country but cut across many countries in the continent. This review provides useful information and synthesised insights that support current and future bibliography queries, research and studies of rivers and streams of South America. It is also noted here that both indices of natural and anthropogenic processes are dictating various environmental challenges confronting surface water systems. The knowledge of the processes and their effects are very important if a proper plan is to be made in addressing those challenges. It is expected that this study serves as a resource for understanding the dynamics of different surface water systems of the continent and as filling the knowledge gap on synthesising the various environmental issues affecting the surface water systems.",

      "abstract": "Production, emission, and absorption of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) in ecosystem soils and associated impacts of nutrient availability are unclear; thus, predictions of effects of global change on source-sink dynamic under increased atmospheric N deposition and nutrition imbalances are limited. Here, we report the dynamics of soil BVOCs under field conditions from two undisturbed tropical rainforests from French Guiana. We analyzed effects of experimental soil applications of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and N + P on soil BVOC exchanges (in particular of total terpenes, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes), to determine source and sink dynamics between seasons (dry and wet) and elevations (upper and lower elevations corresponding to top of the hills (30 m high) and bottom of the valley). We identified 45 soil terpenoids compounds emitted to the atmosphere, comprising 26 monoterpenes and 19 sesquiterpenes; of these, it was possible to identify 13 and 7 compounds, respectively. Under ambient conditions, soils acted as sinks of these BVOCs, with greatest soil uptake recorded for sesquiterpenes at upper elevations during the wet season (-282 μg m-2 h-1). Fertilization shifted soils from a sink to source, with greatest levels of terpene emissions recorded at upper elevations during the wet season, following the addition of N (monoterpenes: 406 μg m-2 h-1) and P (sesquiterpenes: 210 μg m-2 h-1). Total soil terpene emission rates were negatively correlated with total atmospheric terpene concentrations. These results indicate likely shifts in tropical soils from sink to source of atmospheric terpenes under projected increases in N deposition under global change, with potential impacts on regional-scale atmospheric chemistry balance and ecosystem function.",

      "abstract": "Plant phenology characterises the seasonal cyclicity of biological events such as budburst, flowering, fructification, leaf senescence and leaf fall. These biological events are genetically pre-determined but also strongly modulated by climatic conditions, particularly temperature, daylength and water availability. Therefore, the timing of these events is considered as a good indicator of climate change impacts and as a key parameter for understanding and modelling vegetation–climate interactions. In situ observations, empirical or bioclimatic models and remotely sensed time-series data constitute the three possible ways for monitoring the timing of plant phenological events. Remote sensing has the advantage of being the only way of surface sampling at high temporal frequency and, in the case of satellite-based remote sensing, over large regions. Nevertheless, exogenous factors, particularly atmospheric conditions, lead to some uncertainties on the seasonal course of surface reflectance and cause bias in the identification of vegetation phenological events. Since 2005, a network of forest and herbaceous sites has been equipped with laboratory made NDVI sensors to monitor the temporal dynamics of canopy structure and phenology at an intra-daily time step. In this study, we present recent results obtained in several contrasting biomes in France, French Guiana, Belgium and Congo. These sites represent a gradient of vegetation ecosystems: the main evergreen and deciduous forest ecosystems in temperate climate region, an evergreen tropical rain forest in French Guiana, an herbaceous savanna ecosystem in Congo, and a succession of three annual crops in Belgium. In this paper, (1) we provide an accurate description of the seasonal dynamics of vegetation cover in these different ecosystems (2) we identify the most relevant remotely sensed markers from NDVI time-series for determining the dates of the main phenological events that characterize these ecosystems and (3) we discuss the relationships between temporal canopy dynamics and climate factors. In addition to its importance for phenological studies, this ground-based Network of NDVI measurement provides data needed for the calibration and direct validation of satellite observations and products.",

      "abstract": "Sub-oxic overturning mudbanks originating in the Amazon outlet and traveling northwestward along the coast of South America store 3.5Tg organic carbon on the Amazon shelf, annually. The predominance of old soil carbon burial associated with the sediment has been supported by relatively old bulk radiocarbon ages ( 2200–3200 14Cy) reported, but this amount has yet to be quantified for this dynamic setting. Here, we employ ramped pyrolysis radiocarbon dating to mudbank sediments from three cores to further constrain the amount of refractory sedimentary organic carbon present. Using radiocarbon age as a proxy for reactivity, we find that at least 36% of this organic carbon is pre-aged refractory terrestrial organic carbon, likely sourced from terrestrial soils and averaging ages of 16,100±300 14Cy. This implies significant preservation of pre-aged terrestrial soil material in this marine environment despite the mobility and oxygen availability in the muds. Concurrently, an average of 77% of this organic material is aged over 1000 14Cy, consistent with previous estimates that the majority of organic carbon buried along the shelf is refractory. Analyses of extracted lignin phenols and terrestrial humic acids also support this preservation of refractory terrestrial material. These data indicate that sediment discharged from the Amazon River may preserve refractory terrestrial carbon in marine sediments at a minimum of 3.1TgC/y, which is more efficient than originally thought.",

      "abstract": "Scientists still poorly understand how biotic interactions and dispersal limitation jointly interact and affect the ability of species to track suitable habitats under climate change. Here, we examine how animal-plant interactions and dispersal limitations might affect the responses of Brazil nut-dependent frogs facing projected climate change. Using ecological niche modelling and dispersal simulations, we forecast the future distributions of the Brazil nut tree and three commensalist frog species over time (2030, 2050, 2070, and 2090) in the regional rivalry (SSP370) scenario that includes great challenges to mitigation and adaptation. With the exception of one species, projections point to a decrease in suitable habitats of up to 40.6%. For frog species with potential reductions of co-occurrence areas, this is expected to reduce up to 23.8% of suitable areas for binomial animal-plant relationships. Even so, biotic interactions should not be lost over time. Species will depend on their own dispersal abilities to reach analogous climates in the future for maintaining ecological and evolutionary processes associated with commensal taxa. However, ecological and evolutionary processes associated with commensal taxa should be maintained in accordance with their own dispersal ability. When dispersal limitation is included in the models, the suitable range of all three frog species is reduced considerably by the end of the century. This highlights the importance of dispersal limitation inclusion for forecasting future distribution ranges when biotic interactions matter.",

      "abstract": "Mangroves are located at the land-sea interface and are therefore confronted with human settlement in the coastal areas and associated pressures and uses. This unique habitat provides important ecosystem services to coastal communities worldwide, but the global decline of their surface area and their degradation over the past decades has put coastal communities even more at risk from the effects of climate change. This paper aims to present the first ecosystem services valuation of the mangroves of the French overseas Territories. We provide the economic value of mangroves for coastal protection, carbon sequestration, water purification and fish biomass production. We coupled a geospatial analysis of mangrove's distribution with the characterisation of land artificialisation behind mangroves. Then we developed a vulnerability index based on multiple indicators of exposure to environmental and anthropogenic stressors, mangroves' sensitivity to pressures, and mangroves' adaptive capacity to adjust their production functions accordingly. We estimated the monetary value of regulation and support services provided by mangroves in French overseas territories to be on average EUR 1.6 billion annually, 60% of which is carbon sequestration, 28% coastal protection, 7% water purification and 6% fish biomass production. When considering mangroves services without the vulnerability adjustment, the total value for those services would reach EUR 2 billion per year. Although much of the spatio-temporal variability in mangrove functioning could not be considered given the spatial scale of our study, these results demonstrate the value and socio-economic importance of mangroves to face and adapt from the effects of coastal change, at local and national scales, but also highlight the loss of services due to their vulnerability. This paper emphasises on the value of ecosystem services provided by mangroves to face coastal change so that a service-based approach to conservation would plead for increased national investment into their protection.",

Using limnology theory as a basis, the biogeochemical cycle of carbon in the environment is understood to be the main mechanism for generating reservoir based GHG emissions. A summary of relevant research in South American tropical rain forests and the Canada’s temperate zone, also shows the extent of current systematic analysis of GHG emission research.

      "abstract": "The prevalence of allergic airway diseases such as asthma and rhinitis has increased dramatically to epidemic proportions worldwide. Besides air pollution from industry derived emissions and motor vehicles, the rising trend can only be explained by gross changes in the environments where we live. The world economy has been transformed over the last 25 years with developing countries being at the core of these changes. Around the planet, in both developed and developing countries, environments are undergoing profound changes. Many of these changes are considered to have negative effects on respiratory health and to enhance the frequency and severity of respiratory diseases such as asthma in the general population. Increased concentrations of greenhouse gases, and especially carbon dioxide (CO2), in the atmosphere have already warmed the planet substantially, causing more severe and prolonged heat waves, variability in temperature, increased air pollution, forest fires, droughts, and floods – all of which can put the respiratory health of the public at risk. These changes in climate and air quality have a measurable impact not only on the morbidity but also the mortality of patients with asthma and other respiratory diseases. The massive increase in emissions of air pollutants due to economic and industrial growth in the last century has made air quality an environmental problem of the first order in a large number of regions of the world. A body of evidence suggests that major changes to our world are occurring and involve the atmosphere and its associated climate. These changes, including global warming induced by human activity, have an impact on the biosphere, biodiversity, and the human environment. Mitigating this huge health impact and reversing the effects of these changes are major challenges. This statement of the World Allergy Organization (WAO) raises the importance of this health hazard and highlights the facts on climate-related health impacts, including: deaths and acute morbidity due to heat waves and extreme meteorological events; increased frequency of acute cardio-respiratory events due to higher concentrations of ground level ozone; changes in the frequency of respiratory diseases due to trans-boundary particle pollution; altered spatial and temporal distribution of allergens (pollens, molds, and mites); and some infectious disease vectors. According to this report, these impacts will not only affect those with current asthma but also increase the incidence and prevalence of allergic respiratory conditions and of asthma. The effects of climate change on respiratory allergy are still not well defined, and more studies addressing this topic are needed. Global warming is expected to affect the start, duration, and intensity of the pollen season on the one hand, and the rate of asthma exacerbations due to air pollution, respiratory infections, and/or cold air inhalation, and other conditions on the other hand.",

      "abstract": "Brazil has an energy system with a hydrothermal characteristic that interconnects consumers and generators covering 98% of the demand for energy supplies. Most of the plants are concentrated in the southeast region, where the largest consumers and the largest population concentration are located. The expansion of this system, considering the hydroelectric contributions, will occur exploring the potentials located in the Amazon region. This analysis paper shows that the variations imposed by climate changes on some climatological variables create significant uncertainties about the power generation forecasts of the hydroelectric power plants to be installed in the Amazon, thus compromising the financial economic feasibility of these enterprises and also possibly compromising the expansion plans of the Brazilian energy system. The methodological approach uses information from various climate change scenarios and compares those with historical hydrological patterns and generation information. By exploring the characteristics of a large-scale hydrothermal system with high dependence on water resources, this paper provides valuable insights on how energy policy would address hydroelectric vulnerabilities and climate change. This analysis is focused on the Brazilian case but reveals important issues related to systems with hydro thermal characteristics.",

      "abstract": "Habitat loss and more recently, climate change are primary challenges to the effectiveness of protected area networks (PANs) in species conservation within many archipelagic biodiversity hotspots across the globe. An environmental niche model (ENM) of 11 high-conservation-value tree species was used to assess the effectiveness of the PAN within the Caribbean island of Trinidad under future (2050s) climate conditions. Overlay analyses were conducted inside and outside of existing PANs to determine the proportions of natural and plantation (monoculture) forests. Proportions of this species group’s climate space projected to be critical for conservation (combination of stable and expanding zones or ‘Z4’) that are under forest cover were also calculated. Approximately 63% of Trinidad is forested, with the majority of plantation forests located within the PAN, producing noticeable areas of cleared forest when harvested. The ENM projected a drastic reduction in climate space for this group of high-conservation-value tree species across the island. However, approximately 54% of the Z4 space was projected to occur within the PAN; and 61% of the Z4 falling outside the PAN was under forest cover. Consequently, conservation of this species group could be greatly enhanced by increasing the proportion of its Z4 climate space outside the PAN under maintained forest/secondary vegetation cover. Given the small size of small island states (SIS) (such as those in the Caribbean) relative to the macro-scale of climate change, a more effective means of managing climate-induced species loss could involve the development of regional-scale PANs rather than separate efforts of individual SIS.",

      "abstract": "Fluctuations of total calcium carbonate content in eight western Equatorial Atlantic cores are used to evaluate Quaternary climate change. Both pelagic Mid-Atlantic Ridge and terrigenous-rich continental-rise cores that span the last 130,000 years show identical carbonate fluctuations which accurately reflect climatic oscillations during the Holocene, Wisconsin Glacial, and Last Interglacial. The carbonate fluctuations reveal a 20,000-year periodicity for warm-cold (interstadial-stadial) cycles with carbonate maxima reflecting interstadials and minima reflecting stadials. The carbonate fluctuations correlate in detail with other time scales for climatic oscillations deduced previously from radiometrically-dated sea-level maxima, solar insolation fluctuations, and North American ice-margin fluctuations. Pelagic cores spanning the last 500,000 years do not clearly reflect the 20,000-year cold-warm cycles but do show the 100,000-year glacial-interglacial cycles previously revealed by oxygen-isotope variations. The carbonate fluctuations in another core, which contains a continuous record of the last 1,800,000 years, indicates that 15 to 20 of these 100,000-year cycles have occurred during this period. The carbonate fluctuations of two cores suggest that the Atlantic circulated faster during glacials than during interglacials. A core from the Demerara Plateau (2000-m depth) has anomalous carbonate fluctuations plus expanded interglacial and shortened glacial sections that suggest faster circulation of surface water masses during glacials. The sediments of a pelagic core, which were deposited beneath the Antarctic Bottom Water, have undergone severe carbonate dissolution during glacials. These cycles apparently indicate an increase in production and faster circulation of the Antarctic Bottom Water during glacials.",

      "abstract": "The inland fisheries sector is central for subsistence in many regions worldwide. The exploitation of fish resources is expected to increase along with the growing human population, with underlying conservation issues in regions with high biodiversity value. The small fishery of the Maroni River, French Guiana, is a hotspot of biodiversity and endemism where resource depletion is suspected. We surveyed 754 boat landings in seven villages located in the upper half of the watershed, representing > 6300 fish during the study period (November 2013 - September 2014). Fishers used canoes with outboard engines almost exclusively (75 %) and fished within 32 km of their villages. Most fish were caught in trammel nets (81 %); the 20 most-landed species represented more than 87 % of catches. Depending on the village, daily catches and biomass averaged 6–14 fish and 1.7−13 kg per boat landing, respectively. Seven control sites located outside of the fishing grounds were fished to identify potential differences in catch per unit effort and fish size. Per 100 m2 of trammel net, mean catches ranged from 4 to 13 and 8–29 fish in the villages and control sites, respectively, while fish biomass ranged from 0.9 to 4 and 3.2−7 kg in villages and control sites, respectively. For all species combined, fish caught at control sites were bigger than those landed in villages. This difference was significant for nine of the most-landed species. Differences in fishing techniques and fish catches between villages illustrated the gradual disappearance of the ancestral subsistence fishing. Our results support indications that the fish community in the upper Maroni River is harvested intensively, address the issue of sustainability of the fishery there, and call attention to the need to conserve the river’s remarkable biodiversity.",

However, these small-scale regeneration mechanisms alone cannot account for the different patterns of species distribution, plant communities and population structures found in this habitat. The presence of charcoal layers in the soil and the study of sediments along streams suggest that large-scale forest fires deeply affected the tropical forest vegetation, even in high rainfall areas such as French Guiana. Many atypical plant distribution and population structure patterns, in relation to what would be expected from present-time regeneration processes, can be explained by these large-scale events which happened during the last few thousand years.",

      "abstract": "Mangrove wetlands possess four important characteristics as one of the unique marine ecosystems, and are found in the intertidal coastal regions of the tropics and subtropics in the world, mainly between latitudes 25° N and 25° S. The total area of the global mangrove forest is about 1.7 million hectares, spanning over 118 countries and territories. Mangroves play an important ecological role and functioning as a tropical coastal ecosystem with a total net primary productivity as high as 2000 g C·m−2·a−1. Mangrove ecosystems serve a key role in the maintenance and protection for tropical and subtropical marine biodiversity and a very important function in the global biogeochemical processes and climate change. Mangrove wetlands, situated between the terrestrial land and the oceans, are sensitive ecosystems not only to the physical environmental changes also to anthropogenic processes from urbanization and economic development. A rich diversity and communities of flora, fauna, and microorganisms is associated with the mangrove ecosystems and they include both visible organisms and non-visible ones of fungi, bacteria and archaea. These microorganisms play an important ecological role and function in the cycling of nutrients. Mangroves are typical marine ecosystems that are closely associated with the global climate change and can play a positive role. The survival and distribution of mangroves, to serve as an important ecological barrier along the coast, have also been affected by anthropogenic activities and global climate change. The present article reviews the impacts for global climate change on mangroves in terms of global warming, sea-level rising, atmospheric CO2 concentration increasing and extreme weather. It also touches onto the important microbial geochemical processes that are linked to climate change. Archaea are also given attention due to the recent findings on their ubiquity in mangrove and their potential ecological function. The global climate change will bring great challenges and opportunities to research, maintain and development of mangroves in the future.",

      "abstract": "Mangrove ecosystems have long been considered essential habitats and are commonly viewed and referred to as “nursery areas”. They are highly sensitive to climate change, and environmental transformations in these ecosystems are expected. The Sine Saloum estuary is a case of a system affected by global climate change where reduced precipitation and temperature increase have resulted in an inversion of the salinity gradient. Within the estuary, the composition and structure of the larval fish community related to environmental parameters were investigated using neuston and ring trawl nets. Larval fishes were sampled at 16 stations distributed along a salinity and distance-to-the-sea gradient during four field campaigns (November 2013, February, June, and August 2014) covering an annual cycle. This is the first study documenting the spatial and temporal assemblages of fish larvae in an inverse estuary. The total of 41 taxa representing 24 families and 34 genus identified in this study was lower than that of other tropical estuaries. Clupeidae spp. was the dominant taxon, accounting for 28.9% of the total number of fish larvae caught, followed by Gerreidae spp. (21.1%), Hyporamphus picarti (18.8%), Diplodus bellottii (8.9%), Hypleurochilus langi (4.8%), Mugilidae spp. (4.4%), and Gobiidae sp.1 (3.5%). A total of 20 taxa were recorded within the upper estuary region, whereas 29 and 37 taxa were observed in the middle and lower reaches, respectively. While larval fish were captured at all sites and during all seasons, abundances and richness decreased with increasing salinity. Larval fish assemblages also showed a clear vertical structure corresponding to three distinct water strata. Salinity, water temperature, and dissolved oxygen were the variables that best explained the spatial and temporal differences in larval fish assemblages. It is difficult to forecast the future situation for this system but so far, compared to other mangrove estuarine systems, we have observed the loss of freshwater species in favour of species of marine origin. The information provided in the present study is a contribution to the knowledge of tropical biodiversity and modifications of the ichthyoplankton communities in the context of climate change and future green fund action.",

      "abstract": "A global systematic sampling scheme has been developed by the UN FAO and the EC TREES project to estimate rates of deforestation at global or continental levels at intervals of 5 to 10 years. This global scheme can be intensified to produce results at the national level. In this paper, using surrogate observations, we compare the deforestation estimates derived from these two levels of sampling intensities (one, the global, for the Brazilian Amazon the other, national, for French Guiana) to estimates derived from the official inventories. We also report the precisions that are achieved due to sampling errors and, in the case of French Guiana, compare such precision with the official inventory precision. We extract nine sample data sets from the official wall-to-wall deforestation map derived from satellite interpretations produced for the Brazilian Amazon for the year 2002 to 2003. This global sampling scheme estimate gives 2.81 million ha of deforestation (mean from nine simulated replicates) with a standard error of 0.10 million ha. This compares with the full population estimate from the wall-to-wall interpretations of 2.73 million ha deforested, which is within one standard error of our sampling test estimate. The relative difference between the mean estimate from sampling approach and the full population estimate is 3.1%, and the standard error represents 4.0% of the full population estimate. This global sampling is then intensified to a territorial level with a case study over French Guiana to estimate deforestation between the years 1990 and 2006. For the historical reference period, 1990, Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper data were used. A coverage of SPOT-HRV imagery at 20 m × 20 m resolution acquired at the Cayenne receiving station in French Guiana was used for year 2006. Our estimates from the intensified global sampling scheme over French Guiana are compared with those produced by the national authority to report on deforestation rates under the Kyoto protocol rules for its overseas department. The latter estimates come from a sample of nearly 17,000 plots analyzed from same spatial imagery acquired between year 1990 and year 2006. This sampling scheme is derived from the traditional forest inventory methods carried out by IFN (Inventaire Forestier National). Our intensified global sampling scheme leads to an estimate of 96,650 ha deforested between 1990 and 2006, which is within the 95% confidence interval of the IFN sampling scheme, which gives an estimate of 91,722 ha, representing a relative difference from the IFN of 5.4%. These results demonstrate that the intensification of the global sampling scheme can provide forest area change estimates close to those achieved by official forest inventories (<6%), with precisions of between 4% and 7%, although we only estimate errors from sampling, not from the use of surrogate data. Such methods could be used by developing countries to demonstrate that they are fulfilling requirements for reducing emissions from deforestation in the framework of an REDD (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation in Developing Countries) mechanism under discussion within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Monitoring systems at national levels in tropical countries can also benefit from pan-tropical and regional observations, to ensure consistency between different national monitoring systems.",

      "abstract": "Shifting suitable range limits under global warming will threaten many species. Modeling and mapping these potential range shifts is important for conservation. As global warming will introduce new sets of abiotic conditions, predictive empirical niche models may not perform well and the best method to model a specie's projected range shifts may be to model their fundamental niche with a biophysical mechanistic niche model. However, this class of model requires many physiological parameters that are difficult to measure for species not easily kept in captivity. It is also difficult to estimate these parameters for marine species given the interactions among their in-water motion, metabolism, and heat transfer. To surmount these difficulties, we use our previously verified novel technique combining 3D digital design, computational fluid dynamics, and finite volume heat transfer modeling to find animal core temperatures. We then use this method to build a fundamental niche map for internesting and nesting leatherback sea turtles (Dermochelys coriacea). With these niche maps we analyze three main nesting areas. We show that global warming poses a large overheating risk to leatherbacks in Southeast Asia, a slight risk to leatherbacks in the West Atlantic and a low risk to leatherbacks in the East Atlantic. We also show that the impact may be less on leatherbacks that shift their nesting location or who are smaller. Methods such these are important to produce efficiently and economically accurate maps of regions that will become inhospitable to species under global warming conditions.",

      "abstract": "Interest in the potential effects of global climate change on forest ecosystems is increasing, but little is known about their effects on canopy communities, even though their reliance on atmospheric moisture and nutrients suggest that they are sensitive to current predictions of climatic change. We conducted a field experiment to assess the potential impacts of predicted climate change on the growth and health of four common non-vascular epiphytes at three elevations in a subtropical montane moist evergreen broad-leaved forest in southwest China. Even slight changes in climate resulted in remarkably reduced rates of growth and detrimental effects on the health of the transplanted epiphyte species over 2years. Non-vascular epiphytes in this forest type respond much more rapidly to changes in water availability than terrestrial trees. The non-vascular lichen, Nephromopsis pallescens, is highly sensitive to changes in moisture and temperature, and could be adopted as a climate change indicator. Non-vascular epiphyte species may be negatively affected or even severely damaged in the future in subtropical montane forests, as climate conditions are predicted to be warmer and drier. This experiment confirms previous model projections and implies that conservation efforts to maintain the stability and resiliency of montane forest ecosystem to climate change should include epiphyte communities.",

      "abstract": "Forecasting the effects of global change on biodiversity is necessary to anticipate the threats operating at different scales in space and time. Climate change may create unsuitable environmental conditions, forcing species to move to persist. However, land-use changes create barriers that limit the access of some species to future available habitats. Here, we project the impacts of climate and land-use change on 228 Neotropical bat species by forecasting changes in environmental suitability, while accounting for the effect of habitat type specialization and simulating dispersal across suitable patches. We also identify the most vulnerable ecoregions and those that may offer future stable refugia. We further investigate potential functional changes by analysing the response of different trophic guilds. We found that the range contraction of habitat specialists, especially frugivores, was more frequent and stronger under all simulated scenarios. Projected changes differ markedly across ecoregions. While the Amazon region is likely to undergo high turnover rates in bat composition, the Andean grassland, Cerrado and Chaco might experience the greatest losses. The expansion of habitat generalists, which forage in open areas and commonly establish large colonies in manmade structures, coupled with the range contraction of habitat specialists is projected to homogenize bat communities across the Neotropics. Overall, dispersal will likely be the key for the future of Neotropical bat diversity. Therefore, safeguarding the refugia highlighted here, by expanding and connecting the existing network of protected areas, for example, may allow species to move in response to global change.",

      "abstract": "One third of contemporary tropical forests is designated by national forest services for timber production. Tropical forests are also increasingly affected by anthropogenic disturbances. However, there is still much uncertainty around the capacity of tropical forests to recover their timber volume after logging as well as other disturbances such as fires, large blow-downs and extreme droughts, and thus on the long-term sustainability of logging. We developed an original Bayesian hierarchical model of Volume Dynamics with Differential Equations (VDDE) to infer the dynamic of timber volumes as the result of two ecosystem processes: volume gains from tree growth and volume losses from tree mortality. Both processes are expressed as explicit functions of the forest maturity, i.e. the overall successional stage of the forest that primarily depends on the frequency and severity of the disturbances that the forest has undergone. As a case study, the VDDE model was calibrated with data from Paracou, a long-term disturbance experiment in a neotropical forest where over 56 ha of permanent forest plots were logged with different intensities and censused for 31 years. With this model, we could predict timber recovery at Paracou at the end of a cutting cycle depending on the logging intensity, the rotation cycle length, and the proportion of commercial volume. The VDDE modelling framework developed presents three main advantages: (i) it can be calibrated with large tree inventories which are widely available from national forest inventories or logging concession management plans and are easy to measure, both on the field and with remote sensing; (ii) it depends on only a few input parameters, which can be an advantage in tropical regions where data availability is scarce; (iii) the modelling framework is flexible enough to explicitly include the effect of other types of disturbances (both natural and anthropogenic: e.g. blow-downs, fires and climate change) on the forest maturity, and thus to predict future timber provision in the tropics in a context of global changes.",

      "abstract": "The impact of climatic changes that occurred during the last glacial maximum and the Holocene on vegetation changes in the Amazon Basin and the Guiana Shield are still widely debated. The aim of our study was to investigate whether major changes in vegetation (i.e. transitions between rainforests and C4 savannas) occurred in northern French Guiana during the Holocene. We measured variations in the δ13C of soil organic matter at eight sites now occupied by forest or savannah. The forest sites were selected to cover two regions (forest refugia and peneplains) which are thought to have experienced different intensities of disturbance during the latest Pleistocene and the Holocene. We found that none of the forest sites underwent major disturbances during the Holocene, i.e. they were not replaced by C4 savannahs or C4 forest savannahs for long periods. Our results thus suggest that tropical rainforests in northern French Guiana were resilient to drier climatic conditions during the Holocene. Nevertheless, geographical and vertical variations in the 13C of SOM were compatible with minor changes in vegetation, variations in soil processes or in soil physical properties.",

      "abstract": "We analyze the effects of changing patterns of thermal availability, in space and time, on the performance of small ectotherms. We approach this problem by breaking it into a series of smaller steps, focusing on: (1) how macroclimates interact with living and nonliving objects in the environment to produce a mosaic of thermal microclimates and (2) how mobile ectotherms filter those microclimates into realized body temperatures by moving around in them. Although the first step (generation of mosaics) is conceptually straightforward, there still exists no general framework for predicting spatial and temporal patterns of microclimatic variation. We organize potential variation along three axes—the nature of the objects producing the microclimates (abiotic versus biotic), how microclimates translate macroclimatic variation (amplify versus buffer), and the temporal and spatial scales over which microclimatic conditions vary (long versus short). From this organization, we propose several general rules about patterns of microclimatic diversity. To examine the second step (behavioral sampling of locally available microclimates), we construct a set of models that simulate ectotherms moving on a thermal landscape according to simple sets of diffusion-based rules. The models explore the effects of both changes in body size (which affect the time scale over which organisms integrate operative body temperatures) and increases in the mean and variance of temperature on the thermal landscape. Collectively, the models indicate that both simple behavioral rules and interactions between body size and spatial patterns of thermal variation can profoundly affect the distribution of realized body temperatures experienced by ectotherms. These analyses emphasize the rich set of problems still to solve before arriving at a general, predictive theory of the biological consequences of climate change.",

      "abstract": "Rainfall erosivity is the driving factor for soil erosion and can be potentially affected by climate change, impacting agriculture and the environment. In this study, we sought to project the impact of climate change on the long-term average annual rainfall erosivity (R-factor) and mean annual precipitation in South America. The CanESM2, HadGEM2-ES, and MIROC5 global circulation models (GCMs) and the average of the GCMs (GCM-Ensemble) downscaled by the Eta/CPTEC model at a spatial resolution of 20 km in the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 were applied in this study. A geographical model to estimate the R-factor across South America was fitted. This model was based on latitude, longitude, altitude, and mean annual precipitation as inputs obtained from the WorldClim database. Using this model, the first R-factor map for South America was developed (for the baseline period: 1961–2005). The GCMs projected mean annual precipitation for three 30-year time periods (time slices: 2010–2040; 2041–2070; 2071–2099). These projections were used to run the R-factor model to assess the impact of climate change. It was observed that the changes were more pronounced in the Amazon Forest region (namely, the North Region, NR, and the Andes North Region, ANR) with a strong reduction in the mean annual precipitation and R-factor throughout the century. The highest increase in the R-factor was projected on the Central and South Andes regions (CAR and SAR) because of the increase in the mean annual precipitation projected by the GCMs. The GCMs pointed contradictory projections for the Central-South Region (CSR), indicating greater uncertainty. An increase in the R-factor was projected for this region, eastern Argentina, and southern Brazil, whereas a decrease in the R-factor was expected for southeastern Brazil. In general, the GCMs projected reductions in the R-factor and annual precipitation for South America, with the highest changes projected from the baseline to the 2010–2040 time slice.",

      "abstract": "Alluvial gold mining activities in the Peruvian Amazon rainforest are responsible for mercury emissions and deforestation. To understand related environmental impacts, specifically toxicity and climate change, this study uses Life Cycle Assessment methodology. Four predominant extraction systems were selected and modelled and three scenarios that reflect currently available gold recovery systems were modelled: amalgamation, amalgamation with mercury recovery through retort system and gravimetric tables. The USEtox and IPCC life cycle impact assessment methods were used to assess the environmental impacts in term of human toxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity and climate change. Results show that for all systems, human toxicity values are governed by mercury emissions in gold recovery activities (ca. 80%). However, the use of retort significantly lowers these impacts (ca. 90%). Machines and diesel use for ore extraction and freighting activities drive freshwater ecotoxicity. Moreover, deforestation has a major contribution on the environmental impacts related to climate change. However, these impacts are dependent on the type of extraction system. Although human toxicity, freshwater ecotoxicity and climate change are frequently studied separately, a direct relationship between them has been identified in this system. Finally, beyond the environmental burdens related to alluvial gold mining, there are impacts affecting the social, cultural, and economic dimensions that will need to be analyzed to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the system.",

      "abstract": "Publisher Summary This chapter reviews the climatic and cultural dynamics in the Brazilian and Guyana and Surinam (Guianas) regions. Paleoclimatological evidence indicates that both Amazonia and the Brazilian coast were cooler and drier prior to ca. 7000 14C yr BP. In both regions, the forest was substantially reduced and the predominant vegetation was grass and shrubs as a result of climatic changes. These ameliorations permitted larger and more sedentary communities, but inherent limitations to intensive agriculture and dependence on wild protein sources placed a ceiling on population concentration throughout the lowlands. This study summarizes the evidence for paleoclimatological fluctuations and prehistoric cultural changes since ca. 13,000 14C yr BP (uncal.) separately for the Coastal Strip and the Amazon Basin. Both the climatological and cultural data indicate that these now distinct regions experienced long- and short-term environmental fluctuations during and since the Pleistocene that favored the emergence and perpetuation of similar general cultural configurations. The achievement of Holocene climatic conditions and stabilization of sea level ca. 5000 14C yr BP had major environmental consequences. It created an ecological barrier between Amazonia and the Coastal Strip and divided each region into a narrow aquatic zone and a large hinterland. Finally, it suggests that in contrast to other parts of the planet, Holocene climatic changes did not significantly improve the opportunities for agricultural intensification and associated cultural development.",

      "abstract": "The effects of climate changes on biotic expansion or divergence is a widely debated topic. This discussion is particularly relevant for northern Amazonia where patches of open vegetation environments that harbor high endemic and specialized species are present in a matrix of tall closed canopy forest. This paper presents the depositional chronology and evolution of an 8.7-m thick stabilized fluvial and eolian sediment profile in a sandy plain substrate that underpins the largest open vegetation enclave in northern Amazonia. Three depositional units were identified using optically stimulated luminescence and radiocarbon ages coupled with grain size, magnetic susceptibility, and reflectance analyses. A lower unit of coarse fluvial silt deposited between 53 and 28 ka is overlain unconformably by a 5-m thick middle unit of fine eolian sand deposited at high accumulation rates between the Last Glacial Maximum (23–19 ka) and Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1; 18.1–14.7 ka) when persistent and long-lasting shifts of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) to the Southern Hemisphere promoted dry and windy conditions in northern South America. An upper 2-m thick unit was deposited when the climate became wetter after HS1, promoting the formation of soils that support open vegetation habitats. This study indicates that abrupt millennial-scale climate events can induce significant changes in the Amazonian landscape, which in turn play an essential role in the distribution and diversification of specialized biota.",

      "abstract": "The microbial communities inhabiting the Atlantic-East Pacific (AEP) mangroves have been poorly studied, and mostly comprise chronically polluted mangroves. In this study, we characterized changes in the structure and diversity of microbial communities of mangroves along the urban-to-rural gradient of the Cayenne estuary (French Guiana, South America) that experience low human impact. The microbial communities were assigned into 50 phyla. Proteobacteria, Chloroflexi, Acidobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Planctomycetes were the most abundant taxa. The environmental determinants found to significantly correlated to the microbial communities at these mangroves were granulometry, dieldrin concentration, pH, and total carbon (TC) content. Furthermore, a precise analysis of the sediment highlights the existence of three types of anthropogenic pressure among the stations: (i) organic matter (OM) enrichment due to the proximity to the city and its wastewater treatment plant, (ii) dieldrin contamination, and (iii) naphthalene contamination. These forms of weak anthropogenic pressure seemed to impact the bacterial population size and microbial assemblages. A decrease in Bathyarchaeota, “Candidatus Nitrosopumilus”, and Nitrospira genera was observed in mangroves subjected to OM enrichment. Mangroves polluted with organic contaminants were enriched in Desulfobacteraceae, Desulfarculaceae, and Acanthopleuribacteraceae (with dieldrin or polychlorobiphenyl contamination), and Chitinophagaceae and Geobacteraceae (with naphthalene contamination). These findings provide insights into the main environmental factors shaping microbial communities of mangroves in the AEP that experience low human impact and allow for the identification of several potential microbial bioindicators of weak anthropogenic pressure.",

      "abstract": "Some South American lowland environments bear impressive legacies of pre-Columbian engineering activities: vestiges of agricultural raised fields that have persisted since their abandonment centuries or millennia ago. We aimed to test the hypothesis that ancient raised fields were “re-engineered” by non-human soil organisms, leading to their maintenance against erosion. In a raised-field landscape in a seasonally flooded coastal savanna of French Guiana, we characterized the distribution of soil macroinvertebrates (ants, termites, earthworms) and plant roots between ancient raised fields (in this site, circular mounds) and inter-mound areas and between dry and wet seasons, and quantified the influence of these organisms on soil physical properties and texture. Social insect colonies were highly concentrated in mound soils; their density and species richness were maintained across seasons. Biomass of plant roots was higher in mounds than in inter-mound areas. Adult earthworms were inactive in deep soil layers during the dry season, becoming active at the surface of mounds during the wet season. Combined engineering activities of these organisms in the soil of ancient raised fields led to the accumulation of stable macroaggregates and pores, which should reduce the redistribution of fine soil particles between mounds and inter-mounds caused by erosion. Since their abandonment, and perhaps before, raised fields have attracted a diverse and abundant community of soil engineers that enhance the stability of mound soils, allowing their maintenance against erosion.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Yellow fever (YF) is primarily transmitted by Haemagogus species of mosquitoes. Under climate change, mosquitoes and the pathogens that they carry are expected to develop faster, potentially impacting the case count and duration of YF outbreaks. The aim of this study was to determine how YF virus outbreaks in Brazil may change under future climate, using ensemble simulations from regional climate models under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios for three time periods: 2011–2040 (short-term), 2041–2070 (mid-term), and 2071–2100 (long-term). Methods A compartmental model was developed to fit the 2017/18 YF outbreak data in Brazil using least squares optimization. To explore the impact of climate change, temperature-sensitive mosquito parameters were set to change over projected time periods using polynomial equations fitted to their relationship with temperature according to the average temperature for years 2011–2040, 2041–2070, and 2071–2100 for climate change scenarios using RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, where RCP4.5/RCP8.5 corresponds to intermediate/high radiative forcing values and to moderate/higher warming trends. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine how the temperature-sensitive parameters impacted model results, and to determine how vaccination could play a role in reducing YF in Brazil. Results Yellow fever case projections for Brazil from the models varied when climate change scenarios were applied, including the peak clinical case incidence, cumulative clinical case incidence, time to peak incidence, and the outbreak duration. Overall, a decrease in YF cases and outbreak duration was observed. Comparing the observed incidence in 2017/18 to the projected incidence in 2070–2100, for RCP4.5, the cumulative case incidence decreased from 184 to 161, and the outbreak duration decreased from 21 to 20 weeks. For RCP8.5, the peak case incidence decreased from 184 to 147, and the outbreak duration decreased from 21 to 17 weeks. The observed decrease was primarily due to temperature increasing beyond that suitable for Haemagogus mosquito survival. Conclusions Climate change is anticipated to have an impact on mosquito-borne diseases. We found outbreaks of YF may reduce in intensity as temperatures increase in Brazil; however, temperature is not the only factor involved with disease transmission. Other factors must be explored to determine the attributable impact of climate change on mosquito-borne diseases.",

      "abstract": "We have generated a detailed oxygen isotope time-series from the fossil coral reefs from offshore Barbados. The Barbados coral-based record is a unique paleoceanographic data set with an equivalent sedimentation rate in excess of 600cm/kyr where not only is the annual signal uniquely preserved but seasonality as well. Oxygen isotope values during the late glacial and LGM (16–2014Ckyrs; 19–24calendarkyrs) are ∼2.3‰ heavier than corresponding living specimens, and indicate a regional cooling on the order of 4.5°C. There is also an isotopic expression of the Bølling-Pre-Boreal climate oscillation, with values reflecting a cooling during the Younger Dryas. Seasonality, a key diagnostic of the state of the climate system, remained the same or slightly less than present and indicates that the observed coolings were a change in the mean state of the western tropical Atlantic. Pan-tropic cooling during the last glaciation is best explained by a change in the radiative balance of the tropics. Variable tropical sea surface temperatures during climate oscillations such as the Younger Dryas challenge the paradigm that climate change only cascades from variations in North Atlantic deep water production.",

      "abstract": "A thorough understanding of how tropical forests respond to climate is important to improve ecosystem process models and to reduce uncertainties in current and future global carbon balance calculations. The Amazon rainforest, a major contributor to the global carbon cycle, is subject to strong intra- and interannual variations in climate conditions. Understanding their effect on carbon fluxes between the ecosystem and the atmosphere and on the resulting carbon balance is still incomplete. We examined the long-term (over a 12-year period; 2004–2015) variations in gross primary productivity (GPP), ecosystem respiration (RE) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in a tropical rainforest in French Guiana and identified key climatic drivers influencing the changes. The study period was characterized by strong differences in climatic conditions among years, particularly differences in the intensity of the dry and wet seasons, as well as differences in annual carbon fluxes and balance. Annual average GPP varied from 3384.9 g C m−2 yr‒1 (95% CI [3320.7, 3445.9]) to 4061.2 g C m−2 yr‒1 (95% CI [3980.1, 4145.0]). RE varied even more than GPP, with a difference of 933.1 C m−2 yr‒1 between the minimum (3020.6 g C m−2 yr‒1; 95% CI [2889.4, 3051.3]) and maximum (3953.7 g C m−2 yr‒1; 95% CI [3887.6, 4019.6]) values. Although NEE showed large interannual variability (nine-fold), from ‒65.6 g C m−2 yr‒1 (95% CI [‒4.4, ‒126.0]) to ‒590.5 g C m−2 yr‒1 (95% CI [‒532.3, ‒651.6]), the forest remained a carbon sink over the 12-year period. A combination of global radiation (Rg), relative extractable water (REW) and soil temperature (Ts) explained 51% of the daily variations for GPP, 30% for RE and 39% for NEE. Global radiation was always the best predictor of these variations, but soil water content and temperature did also influence carbon fluxes and balance. Seasonally, Rg was the major controlling factor for GPP, RE and NEE during the wet season. During the dry season, variations in carbon fluxes and balance were poorly explained by climate factors. Yet, REW was the key driver of variations in NEE during the dry season. This study highlights that, over the long-term, carbon fluxes and balance in such tropical rainforest ecosystems are largely controlled by both radiation and water limitation. Even though variations in Rg have a greater impact on these fluxes, water limitation during seasonal droughts is enough to reduce ecosystem productivity, respiration and carbon uptake. The reduced precipitation expected in tropical rainforest areas under future climatic conditions will therefore strongly influence carbon fluxes and carbon uptake. This study also highlights the importance for land surface or dynamic global vegetation models to consider the main drivers of carbon fluxes and balance separately for dry and wet seasons.",

      "abstract": "The contraction of the amount of suitable habitat due to climate change can result in a species becoming threatened with extinction. Strong evidence supports that this effect will be pronounced for several species of small mammals in the near future. We address these issues using the ensemble technique to generate potential distribution models for Neotropical marsupials associated with aquatic environments, Chironectes minimus and Lutreolina crassicaudata, and predict the effects of climate change on the distribution of these two species. We later evaluate the effectiveness of the Fully Protected Areas for the two species in the present and future scenarios. Based on our models, we recommend priority areas for the conservation of these species, emphasizing conservation efforts across borders between countries. Our results indicated that both species will suffer a significant restriction of their potential distributions until 2050. Our models predicted that the loss of suitable areas will be greater for C. minimus, with only 33% of the original distribution area remaining. The models also indicated that the current system of Fully Protected Areas in the Neotropical region will protect L. crassicaudata in a small area of its current and future potential distribution, inserted in climatically stable areas ( 14%). These scenarios for these species support strong impacts on the biodiversity protection in aquatic environments in the Neotropical region. We strongly recommend the priority planning and implementation of transboundary Fully Protected Areas in stable areas of distribution of these species to maintain the protection of these marsupials and the ecosystems to which they are associated.",

We present a well resolved, time-calibrated, and comprehensive Heliamphora phylogeny estimated using Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood based on nuclear genes (26S, ITS, and PHYC) and secondary calibration. We used stochastic mapping to infer ancestral states of morphological characters and ecological traits. Our ancestral state estimations revealed that the pitcher drainage structures characteristic of the genus transformed from a hole to a slit in single clade, while other features (scape pubescence and hammock-like growth) have been gained and lost multiple times. Habitat was similarly labile in Heliamphora, with multiple transitions from the ancestral highland habitats into the lowlands. Using a Mantel test, we found closely related species tend to be geographically closely distributed. Placing our phylogeny in a historical context, major clades likely emerged through both vicariance and dispersal during the Miocene with more recent diversification driven by vertical displacement during the Pleistocene glacial-interglacial thermal oscillations. Despite the dynamic climatic history experienced by Heliamphora, the temperature changes brought by global warming pose a significant threat, particularly for those species at the highest elevations.",

      "abstract": "We report on the emergence of the epibiotic barnacle Xenobalanus globicipitis in Guiana dolphins (Sotalia guianensis) from Sepetiba Bay, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in September 2018, six months after a lethal morbillivirus epidemic. Small boat surveys were conducted at the entrance and in the interior of the bay from January 2018 to February 2021. Dolphins were photo-identified and classified according to overall spatial use of the Bay. We examined the potential influence of the period and habitat on the prevalence of X. globicipitis. The overall prevalence of the barnacle was 38.7% in 214 dolphins. X. globicipitis was not observed in 99 individually identified dolphins from January to August 2018 (first period) but was seen on 83 of the 194 (42.8%) dolphins photographed from September 2018 to February 2021 (second period). Moreover, in 22 individuals repeatedly photographed during both periods, prevalence was 0% and 91% during the first and second period, respectively. Prevalence was the highest in the dolphins using the entrance of the Bay (55.0%, N = 140), intermediate in animals using equally both the entrance and interior area (42.9%, N = 47), and the lowest (6.4%, N = 7) in those using the interior area only. The calves of five females infested with X. globicipitis were free of barnacles. Based on repeated photographs of barnacles at different growth stage on six dolphins, the periods between first and last sight with the epibiont were (in increasing order) 29, 32, 40, 51, 68 and 78 days. A conservative estimation from the initial settlement to sexual maturity was around 40–45 days. Three individuals of X. globicipitis collected on a stranded dolphin measured 65 mm, 61 mm and 35 mm, the largest recorded size to date. The two large individuals had incubated embryos while the smaller one presented developing gonads. Poor health and an impaired immune response in the dolphins that had survived the morbillivirus epidemic may have favored the introduction of the barnacle, but biotic and abiotic factors could also had played an important role. This paper documents the colonization of an estuarine area by X. globicipitis following ecological changes.",

      "abstract": "Marine turtles are generally viewed as vulnerable to climate change because of the role that temperature plays in the sex determination of embryos, their long life history, long age-to-maturity and their highly migratory nature. Extant species of marine turtles probably arose during the mid–late Jurassic period (180–150 Mya) so have survived past shifts in climate, including glacial periods and warm events and therefore have some capacity for adaptation. The present-day rates of increase of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, and associated temperature changes, are very rapid; the capacity of marine turtles to adapt to this rapid change may be compromised by their relatively long generation times. We consider the evidence and likely consequences of present-day trends of climate change on marine turtles. Impacts are likely to be complex and may be positive as well as negative. For example, rising sea levels and increased storm intensity will negatively impact turtle nesting beaches; however, extreme storms can also lead to coastal accretion. Alteration of wind patterns and ocean currents will have implications for juveniles and adults in the open ocean. Warming temperatures are likely to impact directly all turtle life stages, such as the sex determination of embryos in the nest and growth rates. Warming of 2 °C could potentially result in a large shift in sex ratios towards females at many rookeries, although some populations may be resilient to warming if female biases remain within levels where population success is not impaired. Indirectly, climate change is likely to impact turtles through changes in food availability. The highly migratory nature of turtles and their ability to move considerable distances in short periods of time should increase their resilience to climate change. However, any such resilience of marine turtles to climate change is likely to be severely compromised by other anthropogenic influences. Development of coastlines may threaten nesting beaches and reproductive success, and pollution and eutrophication is threatening important coastal foraging habitats for turtles worldwide. Exploitation and bycatch in other fisheries has seriously reduced marine turtle populations. The synergistic effects of other human-induced stressors may seriously reduce the capacity of some turtle populations to adapt to the current rates of climate change. Conservation recommendations to increase the capacity of marine turtle populations to adapt to climate change include increasing population resilience, for example by the use of turtle exclusion devices in fisheries, protection of nesting beaches from the viewpoints of both conservation and coastal management, and increased international conservation efforts to protect turtles in regions where there is high unregulated or illegal fisheries (including turtle harvesting). Increasing research efforts on the critical knowledge gaps of processes influencing population numbers, such as identifying ocean foraging hotspots or the processes that underlie the initiation of nesting migrations and selection of breeding areas, will inform adaptive management in a changing climate.",

      "abstract": "After noting the forecast of a La Niña episode, associated with heavy rainfall in French Guiana, we monitored the fate of wasp nests before and during the 2006 short rainy season. The population of the most abundant epiponine wasp species, Polybia bistriata, decreased dramatically during the short rainy season (60.6% of the nests disappeared) then remained low for at least 18 months. Colonies that survived moved from the shelter of large, low leaves (a situation well adapted to the previous dry season) of the most frequent substrate tree, Clusia grandiflora (Clusiaceae), to upper leaves, better ventilated and whose orientation provides good protection from the rain. Therefore, the possibility of moving the nest higher during the first rains following the dry season seems very adaptive as colonies that do not do so are eliminated during the La Niña years, whose frequency will increase with global climate change. Résumé La météo prédisant un épisode La Niña associé à de fortes pluies en Guyane française, nous avons suivi le devenir de nids de guêpes avant et après la petite saison des pluies de 2006.

      "abstract": "Kerteszia cruzii is a sylvatic mosquito and the primary vector of Plasmodium spp., which can cause malaria in humans in areas outside the Amazon River basin in Brazil. Anthropic changes in the natural environments are the major drivers of massive deforestation and local climate change, with serious impacts on the dynamics of mosquito communities and on the risk of acquiring malaria. Considering the lack of information on the dynamics of malaria transmission in areas across the Atlantic Forest biome, where Ke. cruzii is the dominant vector, and the impact of climate drivers of malaria, the present study aimed to: (i) investigate the occurrence and survival rate of Ke. cruzii based on the distinct vegetation profiles found in areas across the coastal region of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome; (ii) estimate the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) and survival rates of P. vivax and P. falciparum parasites in Ke. cruzii under current and future scenarios. The potential distribution of Plasmodium spp. was estimated using simulation analyses under distinct scenarios of average temperature increases from 1 °C to 3.7 °C. Our results showed that two conditions are necessary to explain the occurrence and survival of Ke. cruzii: warm temperature and presence of the Atlantic Forest biome. Moreover, both Plasmodium species showed a tendency to decrease their EIP and increase their estimated survival rates in a scenario of higher temperature. Our findings support that the high-risk malaria areas may include the southern region of the distribution range of the Atlantic Forest biome in the coming years. Despite its limitations and assumptions, the present study provides robust evidence of areas with potential to be impacted by malaria incidence in a future scenario. These areas should be monitored in the next decades regarding the occurrence of the mosquito vector and the potential for malaria persistence and increased occurrence.",

      "abstract": "Background Tropical forests cover less than 10 per cent of all land area (1.8 × 107 km2) and over half of the tropical-forest area (1.1 × 107 Km2) is represented by humid tropical forests (also called tropical rainforests). The Amazon basin contains the largest rainforest on Earth, almost 5.8 million km2, and occupies about 40% of South America; more than 60% of the basin is located in Brazil and the rest in Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Peru, Suriname and Venezuela. Over the past decade the positive role of tropical rainforests in capturing large amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) has been demonstrated. In response to the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration, tropical forests act as a global carbon sink. Main body Accumulation of carbon in the tropical terrestrial biosphere strongly contributes to slowing the rate of increase of CO2 into the atmosphere, thus resulting in the reduction of greenhouse gas effect. Tropical rainforests have been estimated to account for 32–36% of terrestrial Net Primary Productivity (NPP) that is the difference between total forest photosynthesis and plant respiration. Tropical rainforests have been acting as a strong carbon sink in this way for decades. However, over the past years, increased concentrations of greenhouse gases, and especially CO2, in the atmosphere have significantly affected the net carbon balance of tropical rainforests, and have warmed the planet substantially driving climate changes through more severe and prolonged heat waves, variability in temperature, increased air pollution, forest fires, droughts, and floods. The role of tropical forests in mitigating climate change is therefore critical. Over the past 30 years almost 600,000 km2 have been deforested in Brazil alone due to the rapid development of Amazonia, this is the reason why currently the region is one of the ‘hotspots’ of global environmental change on the planet. Conclusion Deforestation represents the second largest anthropogenic source of CO2 to the atmosphere, after fossil fuel combustion. There are many causes of deforestation, including socioeconomic and natural factors, such as clear-cutting for agriculture, ranching and development, unsustainable logging for timber, as well as droughts, fires and degradation due to climate change. About natural causes of forest degradation, in the context of the Amazon, the major agent of change in the forest ecosystem would most likely be decreased dry-season precipitation. Of the 23 global climate models employed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in their 2007 report, 50–70% predict a substantial (above 20%) reduction of dry-season rainfall in eastern Amazonia under mid-range greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, 40% in central Amazonia and 20% in the west. While annual carbon emissions from fossil-fuel combustion have been continually increasing since 1960s, historical trends of deforestation and associated carbon emissions have remained poorly understood.",

Moreover, it is assumed that global warming might lead to an increase of infectious disease outbreaks. While a number of reports link disease outbreaks to single weather events, the El Niño/Southern Oscillation and other largescale climate fluctuations, no report unequivocally associates vector-borne discases with increased temperature and the environmental changes expected to accompany it. The complexity of not yet fully understood pathogen transmission dynamics with numerous variables might be an explanation of the problems in assessing the risk factors.",

      "abstract": "An integrated study of O and H isotopes in the lateritic profile of Yaou, French Guiana, was undertaken to investigate the usefulness of stable isotopes as tracers of climatic changes in continental environments. The studied profile is composed of a 27 m thick saprolite, mostly developed in the past under wet-and-dry tropical climate in association with a duricrust, overlain by a 3 m thick yellow latosol formed more recently under present equatorial hot and humid climate. δ18O–δD values determined for weathering goethite (pseudomorphs after pyrite) and kaolinite (microcrystalline clay groundmass) throughout the 30 m deep profile reflect formation temperatures consistent with present (25°C) and realistic past climatic temperatures (20°C–30°C), indicating that weathering minerals formed in isotopic equilibrium with their genetic environment and were not subjected to significant isotope exchange after formation. A distinct shift downward (2‰ for δ18O, 15‰ for δD) from low to high δ18O–δD values occurs around 20 m depth in the saprolite. It is interpreted as recording the change from the past tropical to the present equatorial climate. Goethite and kaolinite in the 5–10 m thick saprolite interval immediately above the active basement weathering front are in isotopic equilibrium with modern water and must have formed under present equatorial-humid conditions. In contrast, goethite and kaolinite found higher up in the saprolite and in the duricrust formed in the past under tropical wet and dry climate from waters distinctly depleted in 18O and D relative to modern water. The marked depletion of paleo-meteoric water at Yaou most likely reflects a more contrasted or “monsoonal” character of the ancient tropical climate. The present study shows that ancient weathering minerals in lateritic profiles preserve their δ18O–δD values and carry a time signal. The time signal is best expressed in minerals formed rapidly at the weathering front and not subjected to post-formational remobilization, such as the goethite pseudomorphs after pyrite occurring at Yaou. Groundmass kaolinite is more susceptible to partial remobilization, through successive dissolution-precipitation reactions, which may obliterate the paleoclimatic signal. Unraveling the climatic record carried by weathering minerals in old soil systems is greatly enhanced by studying both oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions.",

      "abstract": "Many recent studies discuss the influence of climatic and geological events in the evolution of Neotropical biota by correlating these events with dated phylogenetic hypotheses. Myrtaceae is one of the most diverse Neotropical groups and it therefore a good proxy of plant diversity in the region. However, biogeographic studies on Neotropical Myrtaceae are still very limited. Myrcia s.l. is an informal group comprising three accepted genera (Calyptranthes, Marlierea and Myrcia) making up the second largest Neotropical group of Myrtaceae, totalling about 700 species distributed in nine subgroups. Exclusively Neotropical, the group occurs along the whole of the Neotropics with diversity centres in the Caribbean, the Guiana Highlands and the central-eastern Brazil. This study aims to identify the time and place of divergence of Myrcia s.l. lineages, to examine the correlation in light of geological and climatic events in the Neotropics, and to explore relationships among Neotropical biogeographic areas. A dated phylogenetic hypothesis was produced using BEAST and calibrated by placing Paleomyrtinaea princetonensis (56Ma) at the root of the tree; biogeographic analysis used the DEC model with dispersal probabilities between areas based on distance and floristic affinities. Myrcia s.l. originated in the Montane Atlantic Forest between the end of Eocene and early Miocene and this region acted as a secondary cradle for several lineages during the evolution of this group. The Caribbean region was important in the diversification of the Calyptranthes clade while the Guayana shield appears as ancestral area for an older subgroup of Myrcia s.l. The Amazon Forest has relatively low diversity of Myrcia s.l. species but appears to have been important in the initial biogeographic history of old lineages. Lowland Atlantic Forest has high species diversity but species rich lineages did not originate in the area. Diversification of most subgroups of Myrcia s.l. occurred throughout the Miocene, as reported for other Neotropical taxa. During the Miocene, geological events may have influenced the evolution of the Caribbean and Amazon forest lineages, but other regions were geological stable and climate changes were the most likely drivers of diversification. The evolution of many lineages in montane areas suggests that Myrcia s.l. may be particularly adapted to such environments.",

      "abstract": "This paper deals with the biological, ecological and economic impact of global warming and mangrove habitat availability on the French Guiana shrimp fishery. A dynamic bio-economic model is built by employing a shrimp stock's growth function depending on Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and on mangrove surface. The model is empirically calibrated for the French Guiana shrimp fishery using time series collected over 1995–2011. First, two Cobb-Douglas functions, which describe shrimp's natural growth and harvest, are estimated. Then, a Maximum Economic Yield (MEY) harvest rule, based on the optimization of the net present value derived from fishing, is computed. Three management strategies are compared (Closure, Status Quo management, and MEY) under three mangrove surface fluctuations and climatic scenarios: (a) SST and mangrove remain stable, (b) SST rises while mangrove declines, (c) SST rises and mangrove remains stable. The scenarios considering a SST rise are based on the median greenhouse gases emission projections estimated by the IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change). The scenario focused on the reduction of mangrove surface is based on a general rate calculated on a global level. Our study shows that preserving the mangrove will increase the resiliency of French Guiana shrimp fishery in the long run.",

      "abstract": "The genus Gonatodes is a monophyletic group of small-bodied, diurnal geckos distributed across northern South America, Central America, and the Caribbean. We used fragments of three nuclear genes (RAG2, ACM4, and c-mos) and one mitochondrial gene (16S) to estimate phylogenetic relationships among Amazonian species of Gonatodes. We used Penalized Likelihood to estimate timing of diversification in the genus. Most cladogenesis occurred in the Oligocene and early Miocene and coincided with a burst of diversification in other South American animal groups including mollusks, birds, and mammals. The Oligocene and early Miocene were periods dominated by dramatic climate change and Andean orogeny and we suggest that these factors drove the burst of cladogenesis in Gonatodes geckos as well as other taxa. A common pattern in Amazonian taxa is a biogeographic split between the eastern and western Amazon basin. We observed two clades with this spatial distribution, although large differences in timing of divergence between the east–west taxon pairs indicate that these divergences were not the result of a common vicariant event.",

      "abstract": "This work evaluates the potential contribution of renewable energy to energy security in Latin America (LA) in the short and long terms. Two main approaches are used. The first assesses the seasonality and variability of renewable energy resources in LA, as well as their possible complementarities. Variability indices are calculated to assess patterns of wind and solar power resources and a statistical analysis evaluates complementarities between hotspots in the region. The second determines possible impacts on the future long-term wind and solar resource complementarities due to climate change for those regions where complementarity was previously identified. For this, results of two General Circulation Models (GCMs) for two Representative Concentration Pathways - RCPs (RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5) are used. Results show a higher variability for wind power when compared to solar power generation resources both on an hourly and monthly scales. Results also indicate that Brazil can play an important role regarding renewable energy integration in LA, since the country has the strongest capacity to complement and to be complemented by other LA countries. As for the analysis on climate change impacts, results indicate a strong negative impact on the complementarities in the 2071-2100 period, especially for RCP 8.5.",

      "abstract": "Understanding environmental cues determining behaviour and habitat use of species of conservation concern is crucial if one aims at implementing sustainable management of these natural resources. In this way, here, we investigate the thermal and trophic conditions encountered by the critically endangered leatherback sea turtle Dermochelys coriacea during its nesting season in French Guiana where high bycatch rates have been reported. Mean sea water temperatures obtained in situ by animal-borne recorders were 26.6±0.7 °C in the water column, with all but one turtle remaining in water >25 °C during the inter-nesting interval. In terms of prey availability, regular jellyfish stranding events were recorded during the nesting season, on a 1.25-km long section of the nesting beach. The occurrence of jellyfish was supported by benthic trawls performed on the continental shelf, with a total of 45.4 kg of jellyfish collected in 3.5 h exclusively in coastal waters 10 to 20 m deep where water transparency was between 0.8 and 3 m. This is consistent with the at sea distribution area of gravid leatherbacks during their inter-nesting intervals, as they spent almost 70% of their time diving in shallow (<20 m deep) waters in front of the Maroni River estuary. In French Guiana, leatherback's gelatinous prey are thus present in very shallow water close to the nesting site and may be easily exploited by active gravid leatherbacks. This suggests that French Guiana female leatherbacks may be influenced by local trophic conditions and actively prospect productive areas overlapping with local fisheries ground.",

      "abstract": "Compared to temperate estuaries, tropical ones are less documented. Among them, the numerous estuaries along the Guiana shoreline present at least two original features: they are still preserved from anthropogenic modifications, and their hydro-morphodynamics are influenced by longshore migration of outer coastal mud banks. This study deals with the Maroni estuary, a mesotidal preserved tropical estuary, currently spotting more attention to better anticipate changes related to the development of harbour activities. Field data collected over semi-diurnal tidal cycles in the lower estuary revealed the presence of a turbidity maximum and seasonally contrasted hydro-sedimentary features. A one-year 3D hydrodynamic simulation covering a wide-range of tidal and fluvial conditions was performed to further analyse the seasonal variability of stratification and residual circulation patterns. The estuary is well-mixed for a very low river discharge (lower than 200 m3/s). It becomes partly mixed in both spring and neap tide in case of a moderate river discharge of 700 m3/s. The strongest stratification, which could be associated to a salt wedge near the mouth, appears during neap tides combined with higher discharge. Residual currents along the navigation channel are usually seaward except during neap tides when the discharge is large enough (∼700 m3/s) to generate stratification and landward residual current near the bottom to mid depth until the first km 15 from the mouth. Residual inflow starts from the location of the mud bank and extends along the navigation channel near the eastern bank. The inflow extension matches with observed highly turbid areas and fresh mud deposits, suggesting an outer supply of mud. In summary, this exploratory work allows a first description of current dynamics of the Maroni, and is a first step before a comprehensive study of changes in estuarine circulation and fine sediment transport under different configurations of coastal mud banks.",

      "abstract": "French Guiana is a European ultraperipheric region located on the northern Atlantic coast of South America. It constitutes an important forested region for biological conservation in the Neotropics. Although very sparsely populated, with its inhabitants mainly concentrated on the Atlantic coastal strip and along the two main rivers, it is marked by the presence and development of old and new epidemic disease outbreaks, both research and health priorities. In this review paper, we synthetize 15 years of multidisciplinary and integrative research at the interface between wildlife, ecosystem modification, human activities and sociodemographic development, and human health. This study reveals a complex epidemiological landscape marked by important transitional changes, facilitated by increased interconnections between wildlife, land-use change and human occupation and activity, human and trade transportation, demography with substantial immigration, and identified vector and parasite pharmacological resistance. Among other French Guianese characteristics, we demonstrate herein the existence of more complex multi-host disease life cycles than previously described for several disease systems in Central and South America, which clearly indicates that today the greater promiscuity between wildlife and humans due to demographic and economic pressures may offer novel settings for microbes and their hosts to circulate and spread. French Guiana is a microcosm that crystallizes all the current global environmental, demographic and socioeconomic change conditions, which may favor the development of ancient and future infectious diseases.",

      "abstract": "Oxygen isotopic compositions of weathering goethite pseudomorphs after pyrite in the lateritic profile of Yaou, French Guiana, were measured by laser fluorination. The laterite at Yaou is composed of a 25 m thick saprolite overlain by a 3 m thick latosol. Petrographic observations indicate that the pseudomorphic replacement of pyrite by goethite occurs at or near the weathering front and is complete. The goethite pseudomorphs are essentially devoid of Al and are progressively dissolved and partially replaced by a microcrystalline plasma of kaolinite and goethite in the upper horizons (latosol) of the profile. The laser technique used in this study permitted the determination of the δ18O value of individual grains of goethite and the investigation of grain-to-grain variation within a single sample (horizon) as well as vertical variation with depth. In the latosol, the goethite δ18O values range from 0.8 to 3.2%‰ and exhibit significant grain-to-grain and vertical variation. This most likely reflects undetected intragrain contamination with microcrystalline kaolinite. In the saprolite, the goethite δ18O values are consistent, ranging from 1.0 to 1.8%‰ between 3 and 18 m depth, and from 2.5 to 3.3‰ between 23 m depth and the weathering front at 28 m. Oxygen isotope compositions of present groundwater, “soil water” and rainfall at Yaou were also measured, and compared with calculated isotopic compositions for goethite-forming waters. Goethite pseudomorphs in the lower part of the saprolite are in isotopic equilibrium with present groundwater, indicating that they may be forming today or that they formed in the recent past under climatic conditions similar to present conditions. In contrast, goethite pseudomorphs found higher in the profile are not in isotopic equilibrium with present water but with a water depleted in18O by ≈ 1.50% relative to present groundwater. It is suggested that these low-δ18O pseudomorphs are probably older and formed under different paleoclimatic conditions, at a time when climatic regimes were possibly more monsoonal than today. This is in agreement with models of climatic evolution derived from pedological considerations. The results of this study suggest that goethite pseudomorphs in ancient saprolites may preserve their original O isotopic composition acquired at the weathering front, and may, therefore, be used as indicators of changes in weathering-climatic conditions during the evolution of a profile.",

      "abstract": "Operationalizing resilience in fisheries management is a challenging issue in the face of global changes. In this perspective, Grafton et al. (2019) propose a heuristic based on the ‘3Rs’ of resilience, namely resistance, recovery, and robustness. The work presented here applies this generic framework to the coastal fishery of French Guiana, which is under pressure because of both climate change, energy costs and demographic growth. To this end, a dynamic multi-species, resource-based and multi-fleet model accounting for climate and socio-economic uncertainties is developed and calibrated using catch and effort time series. The search for a more resilient management leads us to compare different fishing management strategies and projections including ‘Business as usual’ (bau), ‘Multispecies Maximum Sustainable Yield’ (mmsy) and ‘Multispecies Maximum Economic Yield’ (mmey) strategies. The comparison between the strategies relies on ecological–economic viability goals and thresholds. The two normative strategies mmsy and mmey turn out to provide major gains in terms of the 3Rs and ecological–economic resilience as compared to bau. They both suggest major redistributions in the fishing effort of the different fleets.",

      "abstract": "The intensification of dry seasons is a major threat to freshwater biodiversity in Neotropical regions. Little is known about resistance to drying stress and the underpinning traits in Neotropical freshwater species, so we don’t know whether desiccation resistance allows to anticipate shifts in biological diversity under future climate scenarios. Here, we used the aquatic invertebrates that live in the rainwater-filled leaves of tank bromeliads, to examine the extent to which desiccation resistance of species measured in the laboratory predicts community response to drought intensification in nature. We measured desiccation resistance in 17 invertebrate species (>90% of the biomass usually found in bromeliads of French Guiana) by recording the median lethal time (LT50) of experimental populations exposed to controlled conditions of residual moisture. In the field, we placed rainshelters above tank bromeliads to emulate drought scenarios ranging from the ambient norm to IPCC scenarios and extreme events, and we recorded the response of functional community structure. LT50 ranged from 4.18 to 19.06 days, and was related to cuticle content and dry body mass. Among other functional indicators that represent strategies to optimize resource use under stressful conditions (e.g., habitat use, trophic specialization), LT50 was the best predictor of community structure responses along a gradient of emulated drought intensities. Therefore, species’ LT50s measured under laboratory conditions can be used to forecast aquatic community response to drying stress in nature. Anticipating how species will cope with drought has never been more important for environmental managers to support climate change adaptation. We show that desiccation resistance in freshwater invertebrates is a key indicator of potential population size and local–global range shifts, and this could be especially true in the Neotropics where species have narrow physiological tolerances for climatic variation.",

      "abstract": "This paper presents a survey of the empirical literature on the effects of climate change and weather conditions on the transport sector. Despite mixed evidence on many issues, several patterns can be observed. On a global scale especially shifts in tourism and agricultural production due to increased temperatures may lead to shifts in passenger and freight transport. The predicted rise in sea levels and the associated increase in frequency and intensity of storm surges and flooding incidences may furthermore be some of the most worrying consequences of climate change, especially for coastal areas. Climate change related shifts in weather patterns might also cause infrastructure disruptions. Clear patterns are that precipitation affects road safety by increasing accident frequency but decreasing severity. Precipitation also increases congestion, especially during peak hours. Furthermore, an increased frequency of low water levels may considerably increase costs of inland waterway transport. Despite these insights, the net impact of climate change on generalised costs of the various transport modes are uncertain and ambiguous, with a possible exception for inland waterway transport.",

      "abstract": "This paper deals with fishery management in the face of the ecological and economic effects of global warming. To achieve this, a dynamic bioeconomic model and model-based scenarios are considered, in which the stock's growth function depends on the sea surface temperature. The model is empirically calibrated for the French Guiana shrimp fishery using time series collected over the period 1993–2009. Three fishing effort strategies are then compared under two contrasted IPCC climate scenarios (RCP 8.5 and RCP 2.6). A first harvesting strategy maintains the Status Quo in terms of fishing effort. A more ecologically-oriented strategy based on the closure of the fishery is also considered. A third strategy, which relates to Maximum Economic Yield (MEY), is based on the optimisation of the net present value derived from fishing. The results first show that ‘Status Quo’ fishing intensity combined with global warming leads to the collapse of the fishery in the long run. Secondly, it turns out that the Closure strategy preserves stock viability especially under the optimistic climate scenario. Thirdly, the MEY strategy makes it possible to satisfy bioeconomic performances requirements with positive stock and profit, once again, especially under the optimistic warming scenario. Consequently, MEY emerges as a relevant bioeconomic strategy in terms of adaptation to climate change but only in connection with climate change mitigation.",

      "abstract": "Tropical forests are characterized by large carbon stocks and high biodiversity, but they are increasingly threatened by human activities. Since structure strongly influences the functioning and resilience of forest communities and ecosystems, it is important to quantify it at fine spatial scales. Here, we propose a new simulation-based approach, the “Canopy Constructor”, with which we quantified forest structure and biomass at two tropical forest sites, one in French Guiana, the other in Gabon. In a first step, the Canopy Constructor combines field inventories and airborne lidar scans to create virtual 3D representations of forest canopies that best fit the data. From those, it infers the forests' structure, including crown packing densities and allometric scaling relationships between tree dimensions. In a second step, the results of the first step are extrapolated to create virtual tree inventories over the whole lidar-scanned area. Across the French Guiana and Gabon plots, we reconstructed empirical canopies with a mean absolute error of 3.98 m [95% credibility interval: 3.02, 4.98], or 14.4%, and a small upwards bias of 0.66 m [−0.41, 1.8], or 2.7%. Height-stem diameter allometries were inferred with more precision than crown-stem diameter allometries, with generally larger heights at the Amazonian than the African site, but similar crown-stem diameter allometries. Plot-based aboveground biomass was inferred to be larger in French Guiana with 400.8 t ha−1 [366.2–437.9], compared to 302.2 t ha−1 in Gabon [267.8–336.8] and decreased to 299.8 t ha−1 [275.9–333.9] and 251.8 t ha−1 [206.7–291.7] at the landscape scale, respectively. Predictive accuracy of the extrapolation procedure had an RMSE of 53.7 t ha−1 (14.9%) at the 1 ha scale and 87.6 t ha−1 (24.2%) at the 0.25 ha scale, with a bias of −17.1 t ha−1 (−4.7%). This accuracy was similar to regression-based approaches, but the Canopy Constructor improved the representation of natural heterogeneity considerably, with its range of biomass estimates larger by 54% than regression-based estimates. The Canopy Constructor is a comprehensive inference procedure that provides fine-scale and individual-based reconstructions even in dense tropical forests. It may thus prove vital in the assessment and monitoring of those forests, and has the potential for a wider applicability, for example in the exploration of ecological and physiological relationships in space or the initialisation and calibration of forest growth models.",

      "abstract": "Considering the current threatening conditions of climate change, Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) aims to improve the soil health and its organic carbon stocks by encouraging soil carbon sequestration through conservation practices in agricultural lands. However, the effects of these practices differ due to diverse climatic scenario, soil characteristics and management system. To identify the suitable practices that can be effective under tropical and subtropical conditions, a systematic evaluation in the form of a meta-analysis of these practices and their outcomes was performed over those regions. In this work we have included 516 observations from 84 articles published from 2000 to 2021 to analyse the influence of three CSA practices (conservation tillage, cover crop and biochar application) on the SOC (soil organic carbon) stocks over varying periods of experimentation. In addition to this, the combined effect of CSA and other conservation agronomic practices such as agroforestry has also been considered in the analysis. The results showed that biochar application had the most influence upon SOC stocks in the agricultural lands (25.38%) followed by conservation tillage (18.81%) and cover crop (15.8%). Medium term experiments (6–20 years) of these conservation practices showed about 31.00–96.15%improvement in SOC while the effects gradually diminished in long term experiments (>20 years). The combinations of these practices have been observed to have an evidently positive impact upon the SOC stocks in general. This work provides a systematic evaluation of all the widely performed CSA and other conservation practices and their effects on SOC dynamics under differing management settings.",

      "abstract": "Availability of digital elevation models (DEM) of increased spatial resolution has triggered interest in texture-based methods for automated geomorphometry. This prospect is all the more appealing concerning tropical countries for which mapping of geomorphic entities has remained limited despite its relevance for natural resource assessment and land planning. In this paper we applied to the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) DEM a multiscale texture analysis based on Fourier 2D periodogram (FOTO method) to reach a spatially coherent mapping that would agree with current knowledge over the conterminous territories of French Guiana and Amapa (Brazil). Through a principal component analysis, FOTO-extracted textural features were found complementary and combined with six common physiographic criteria (convexity, wetness index, dissection, elevation, and percent of steep and low slopes) calculated from the DEM. This provided a primary semiautomated mapping of 16 classes of landform types. To increase legibility, we aggregated into eight landscape unit classes that were the most similar in terms of texture and relief criteria while being frequently contiguous. The resulting map was compared with existing maps that were, however, more local or of lesser resolution and informative content over the region of interest. Multiscale Fourier spectra proved useful to depict land surface texture and, in synergy with relief variables, allowed identifying a large variety of landforms for broad-scale geomorphic mapping in the humid tropics.",

      "abstract": "This paper scrutinizes the assertion that knowledge gaps concerning health risks from climate change are unjust, and must be addressed, because they hinder evidence-led interventions to protect vulnerable populations. First, we construct a taxonomy of six inter-related forms of invisibility (social marginalization, forced invisibility by migrants, spatial marginalization, neglected diseases, mental health, uneven climatic monitoring and forecasting) which underlie systematic biases in current understanding of these risks in Latin America, and advocate an approach to climate-health research that draws on intersectionality theory to address these inter-relations. We propose that these invisibilities should be understood as outcomes of structural imbalances in power and resources rather than as haphazard blindspots in scientific and state knowledge. Our thesis, drawing on theories of governmentality, is that context-dependent tensions condition whether or not benefits of making vulnerable populations legible to the state outweigh costs. To be seen is to be politically counted and eligible for rights, yet evidence demonstrates the perils of visibility to disempowered people. For example, flood-relief efforts in remote Amazonia expose marginalized urban river-dwellers to the traumatic prospect of forced relocation and social and economic upheaval. Finally, drawing on research on citizenship in post-colonial settings, we conceptualize climate change as an ‘open moment’ of political rupture, and propose strategies of social accountability, empowerment and trans-disciplinary research which encourage the marginalized to reach out for greater power. These achievements could reduce drawbacks of state legibility and facilitate socially-just governmental action on climate change adaptation that promotes health for all.",

      "abstract": "Temperature-dependent sex determination has been recently characterized for leatherbacks (Dermochelys coriacea) from Playa Grande, on the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. The authors concluded that the pattern of TSD in leatherbacks from Pacific Costal Rica is the same as for leatherbacks from French Guiana, in the Atlantic. However, no statistical tests were performed to validate their conclusion. Here, we use a maximum-likelihood test to look for a possible difference between the populations. We found that the pattern of temperature-dependent sex determination in Atlantic and Pacific leatherbacks was significantly different. The temperature producing 50 % of each sex was not significantly different in both groups, but the range of temperatures producing both sexes was significantly narrower for the French Guiana population. We hypothesize that this difference could reflect a lower genetic polymorphism for temperature-dependent sex determination in this population. A low genetic diversity in the Guiana population compared to the Playa Grande population has been already observed for mitochondrial haplotypes. Our results emphasize the importance of statistical analyses in studies of temperaturedependent sex determination. Résumé La détermination du sexe sensible à la température (TSD) a été récemment caractérisée pour les tortues luths (Dermochelys coriacea) de Playa Grande, sur la côte Pacifique du Costa Rica. Les auteurs concluaient que le profil de réponse à la température des tortues luths du Pacifique était le même que celui de cette même espèce pondant en Guyane française, côté Atlantique. Cependant aucun test statistique n'a été effectué permettant de valider cette conclusion. Un test par le maximum de vraisemblance a été utilisé pour rechercher une différence possible dans les profils de réponse à la température. Nous trouvons que les profils globaux sont en fait significativement différents entre les tortues luths de l'Atlantique et du Pacifique. La température produisant 50 % de chaque sexe n'est pas significativement différente entre les deux groupes, par contre l'intervalle de température produisant les deux sexes est significativement plus étroit pour les tortues luths pondant en Guyane française. Cet intervalle de température plus étroit pourrait refléter une variabilité génétique plus faible pour ce caractère dans cette population. Une diversité génétique plus faible pour les femelles pondant en Guyane française en comparaison de celles pondant à Playa Grande a d'ailleurs déjà été démontrée pour l'ADN mitochondrial. Nos résultats renforcent la nécessité de l'utilisation de tests statistiques pour l'étude de la détermination du sexe sensible à la température.",

      "abstract": "Mangroves can sequester and store massive amounts of CO2 from the atmosphere in the form of live plant and detrital biomass. Large amounts of autochthonous and allochthonous carbon (C) are also stored in sediments, where waterlogged and anoxic conditions inhibit microbial breakdown of organic matter. As a result, C buried in sediments of mangroves can remain there for millennia if left undisturbed, making them critical long-term C sinks. These high levels of aboveground and belowground C stocks have elevated the importance of mangroves and other blue carbon habitats in climate change mitigation and adaptation as well as efforts to protect and restore them. While methods have been developed for quantifying and reporting C stocks, the environmental drivers that influence the accumulation and retention of C stocks in blue carbon habitats are lesser known. Identifying important drivers of C accumulation in blue carbon habitats will increase conservation and restoration efforts so that they can continue to mitigate climate change by offsetting greenhouse gas emissions. Successful restoration and conservation activities can also be used in nationally determined commitments or in voluntary C markets. This chapter will explore the biological, biogeochemical, and geomorphological drivers that influence C burial in mangrove sediments.",

      "abstract": "In Amazonia higher Atlantic sea surface temperatures, greenhouse gases, deforestation and El Niño events result in the greater frequency of severe droughts, although total rainfall has increased due to wetter rainy seasons, something confirmed in French Guiana from available climatic data (1980-2017). Aiming to study the impact of rainfall on ant gardens (i.e., arboreal ant-epiphyte mutualisms that depend on the atmosphere for water; AGs) initiated by the ponerine ant Neoponera goeldii, we conducted surveys around the Petit Saut and Régina areas (mean annual rainfall: ≈3,000 mm and ≈4,000 mm, respectively). Each year, near the end of the dry season we recorded the number of these AGs in 10 × 5 m sections parallel to the roadsides. The Petit Saut survey (1993-2017) revealed that AG density along roadsides varied only slightly in \"wet zones\" situated along ditches, whereas in \"dry zones\" where the soil seasonally dries out it dropped sharply during the drastic 1997 dry season. Then, this density, low due to recurrent droughts, dropped again during the drastic successive 2015-2016 dry seasons. In the Régina survey (2006-2017), we had the opportunity to follow the establishment of AGs in a \"dry zone\". It was represented by a typical sigmoidal curve and then it stabilized with AG densities higher than at its peak in 1996 in dry zones of Petit Saut, showing the importance of rainfall. Here, too, the drastic 2016 dry season adversely affected the AGs. Finally, the epiphytic composition of the AGs was mainly represented by Aechmea mertensii (a tank bromeliad), Anthurium gracile (Araceae) and Codonanthe crassifolia (Gesneriaceae), but AGs with the tank bromeliad are more resistant to droughts. These AGs are at risk in dry zones if drastic successive dry seasons occur in the future as global warming intensifies while those developing in riparian areas might survive.",

      "abstract": "Species exposed to anthropogenic climate change can acclimate, adapt, move, or be extirpated. It is often assumed that movement will be the dominant response, with populations tracking their climate envelopes in space, but the numerous species restricted to specialized substrates cannot easily move. In warmer regions of the world, such edaphic specialists appear to have accumulated in situ over millions of years, persisting despite climate change by local movements, plastic responses, and genetic adaptation. However, past climates were usually cooler than today and rates of warming slower, while edaphic islands are now exposed to multiple additional threats, including mining. Modeling studies that ignore edaphic constraints on climate change responses may therefore give misleading results for a significant proportion of all taxa.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to evaluate the potential for solar energy in the Guiana Shield and propose indicators to encourage the exploitation of solar energy systems in this area. For this, we use the Heliosat-2 optimized method to process images from the geostationary meteorological satellite GOES acquired in the period from April 2010 to July 2015. We calculated the average daily global horizontal irradiation (GHI) and direct normal irradiation (DNI) throughout the study period. The results obtained allowed us to establish four indicators: maps of production potential, the inter-day variability of DNI and GHI, maps of solar panel orientation related to maximum solar potential, and maps of areas where the solar resource is under the exploitable potential threshold. We also added an additional indicator, the suitability of areas for solar system installation depending on the ground slope. Our study shows that the average value of production potential for the entire Guiana Shield is approximately 1780 kWh.kWc−1.year−1 for GHI and 2040 kWh.kWc−1.year−1 for DNI. Comparisons with pyranometer measurements indicate an error relative bias of less than 2% and a relative RMSE of less than 21% for hourly estimates of GHI. Although the Guiana Shield region is covered by many clouds, few areas show insufficient solar potential for the exploitation of GHI and DNI, but the hilly nature of the area limits possible locations of very large power plants and instead favors more medium-sized plants. This is the first study that offers exploitability indicators for solar resources in the Guiana Shield. In conclusion, the established indicators provide a new perspective on the solar potential in the Guiana Shield and are expected to promote the development of new solar energy operating systems.",

      "abstract": "Regeneration of mangroves that occurred within Straits of Malacca over the last 35 years offers an excellent model system to examine how stand dynamics change over time. With exact stand age known, assessment of forest structure, biodiversity and biomass along a natural mangrove development chronosequence provides valuable information to define how long it takes mangrove restoration to return to a natural baseline condition. In natural settings, it is hypothesized that forest structure, diversity and biomass increase with stand age and that these are highest and most complex in intact mangroves. Thus, the study analyzed dynamics in species composition, forest structure and biomass across intact as well as naturally regenerated (NR) stands from 3, 6, 12, 18, and 25 years of age. Intact mangrove stands were structurally more complex and more diverse than younger stands. The preponderance of A. marina regeneration that appear for succession gives rise to a high importance value in the study area. The mean for above-ground and below-ground biomass was 71.00 ± 2.30 and 36.07 ± 0.52 Mg ha−1, respectively. Mean individual tree mass to tree density relationship resembles the mean tree weight–density trajectory of self-thinning even-aged plant populations where mean individual tree mass increased with decreasing density. Naturally regenerated mangroves supported higher tree diversity with complex in stand structure compared to restored mangroves, which were basically comprised of Rhizophora species. Restored mangroves attain higher biomass in a shorter period of time compared to naturally regenerated mangroves. Mangrove restoration should focus on naturally regenerated mangroves in order to increase carbon sequestration and thus provide climate change mitigation. Ecosystem services, biodiversity and climate change mitigation values need to be considered for both mangrove types as restored mangroves lower tree diversity compared to naturally regenerated mangroves of the same age stand. Therefore it is suggested that sustainable management such as silviculture method might be suitable for naturally regenerated mangroves to absorb more carbon from atmosphere and maintain the higher diversity.",

      "abstract": "Granitic outcrop vegetation was compared in 22 inselbergs of French Guiana, South America, using RLQ and fourth-corner analyses to identify the main relationships between environmental gradients and plant traits. At the scale of the whole territory the distribution of species and species traits was mostly driven by a spatially-structured gradient embracing regional climate (annual rainfall), forest matrix (canopy openness), and inselberg features (altitude, shape, habitats, summit forest, degree of epiphytism, fire events). Biogeographic, environmental and past historical factors contribute to explain the variation observed at coarse scale and two groups of inselbergs are identified. A first group occupies the southern peneplain in a semi-open forest matrix and exhibits a higher representation of suffrutescent species and climbers, a lower representation of upright shrubs, a lower degree of Guiana Shield endemism, and a higher incidence of human use and autochory. All these features suggest an adaptation to more disturbed environments linked to past climate changes and savannization and to human influences. A second group, characterized by opposite plant traits, occupies the northern part of French Guiana and the far south within a closed forest matrix. Within archipelagos (inselbergs at less than 7km distance), C-score and Mantel tests revealed a random co-occurrence of plant species and an increase of floristic dissimilarity with distance without any concomitant change in plant traits, respectively, suggesting that spatially-structured stochastic factors (limitation by dispersal) were the driving force of vegetation change at fine scale.",

Our knowledge of the amphibians and reptiles that inhabit the Guiana Highlands has increased substantially in recent decades, but is still incomplete, with enormous geographical gaps and almost total ignorance about species ecology. In this chapter we update the herpetofauna richness known from Pantepui and review the distribution and endemism patterns based on published information. Also, we summarize recent phylogenetic studies that included iconic Pantepui taxa, showing that the current herpetofauna has been modeled by multiple and complex processes of vicariance and dispersal over time; low genetic diversity in Pantepui taxa seems to indicate an important reorganization of these communities during the glaciation cycles of the Pleistocene. Some endemic Pantepui taxa apparently have their origin in the Andes, while others originated in the ancient Guiana Shield and diversified in situ.",

      "abstract": "An important and plausible impact of a changing global climate is altered power generation from hydroelectric dams. Here we project 21st century global hydropower production by forcing a coupled, global hydrological and dam model with three General Circulation Model (GCM) projections run under two emissions scenarios. Dams are simulated using a detailed model that accounts for plant specifications, storage dynamics, reservoir bathymetry and realistic, optimized operations. We show that the inclusion of these features can have a non-trivial effect on the simulated response of hydropower production to changes in climate. Simulation results highlight substantial uncertainty in the direction of change in globally aggregated hydropower production ( −5 to +5% change in mean global production by the 2080s under a high emissions scenario, depending on GCM). Several clearly impacted hotspots are identified, the most prominent of which encompasses the Mediterranean countries in southern Europe, northern Africa and the Middle East. In this region, hydropower production is projected to be reduced by approximately 40% on average by the end of the century under a high emissions scenario. After accounting for each country's dependence on hydropower for meeting its current electricity demands, the Balkans countries emerge as the most vulnerable ( 5–20% loss in total national electricity generation depending on country). On the flipside, a handful of countries in Scandinavia and central Asia are projected to reap a significant increase in total electrical production ( 5–15%) without investing in new power generation facilities.",

      "abstract": "Wildlife trade is considered one of the most significant pathways for the spread of exotic species, as it is present worldwide and crosses abiotic and biotic barriers. In this sense, identifying potential invaders before they are introduced and analyzing the ecological implications of possible escapes of captive species to the wild is an important issue for preventing invasive species impacts. In Brazil, several studies have demonstrated the consequences of wildlife trade on the biogeographic patterns of some species. In this context, using the ten most seized bird species in Brazil, we seek to identify the most suitable areas for invasion of these species in all Brazilian regions, as well as in other South American countries. To this end, we used ecological niche modeling to evaluate region invasibility by the ten assessed species. In addition, natural distribution polygons and actual records were used to evaluate changes in the distribution ranges of the evaluated species. Overall, ‘Red-cowled Cardinal’, ‘Saffron Finch’, ‘Yellow-bellied Seedeater’ and ‘Rufous-collared Sparrow’ reached the highest rate of invasion in susceptible areas. Proportionally, French Guiana, Guyana and Suriname showed the highest amount of invasion potential areas in South America overall. Ecuador and Bolivia reached the highest percentage of suitable areas for four or more species. Regarding Brazil, all regions were suitable for invasion by at least three of the ten analyzed species, whereas the north and midwest were the most vulnerable regions. We discuss the need to consider the animal trade as one of the main means to promote organism translocation and cause alterations in the biogeographical patterns of several species.",

      "abstract": "Space launchers often use aluminized-solid fuel (“propergol”) as propellant and its combustion releases tons of Al2O3 and HCl that sink in terrestrial and aquatic environments, polluting and decreasing water pH. We studied the impact of these events on the biochemical/physiological performance of the freshwater shrimp Macrobrachium jelskii, with wild specimens collected from a non-impacted site in French Guiana. In the laboratory, shrimps were exposed for one week to: i) undisturbed conditions; ii) Al2O3 exposure (0.5 mg L−1) at normal pH (6.6); iii) decreased pH (4.5) (mimicking HCl release in the environment) with no Al2O3; or iv) Al2O3 0.5 mg L−1 and pH 4.5, representing the average conditions found in the water bodies around the Ariane 5 launch pad. Results showed that shrimps bioaccumulated aluminium (Al) regardless of water pH. The combined effect of Al2O3 and low pH caused the most impact: acetylcholinesterase and carboxylesterase activities decreased, indicating neurotoxicity and reduced detoxification capacity, respectively. Animal respiration was enhanced with Al2O3 and pH variations alone, but the synergic interaction of both stressors caused respiration to decrease, suggesting metabolic depression. Oxidative damage followed a similar pattern to respiration rates across conditions, suggesting free radical-mediation in Al toxicity. Antioxidant activities varied among enzymes, with glutathione reductase being the most impacted by Al2O3 exposure. This study shows the importance of addressing space ports’ impact on the environment, setting the bases for selecting the most appropriate biomarkers for future monitoring programs using a widespread and sensitive crustacean in the context of an increasing space-oriented activity across the world.",

      "abstract": "Selective logging causes at least half of the emissions from tropical forest degradation. Reduced-impact logging for climate (RIL-C) is proposed as a way to maintain timber production while minimizing forest damage. Here we synthesize data from 61 coordinated field-based surveys of logging impacts in seven countries across the tropics. We estimate that tropical selective logging emitted 834 Tg CO2 in 2015, 6% of total tropical greenhouse gas emissions. Felling, hauling, and skidding caused 59%, 31%, and 10% of these emissions, respectively. We suggest that RIL-C incentive programs consider a feasible target carbon impact factor of 2.3 Mg emitted per Mg of timber extracted. Operational modifications are needed to achieve this target, such as reduced wood waste, narrower haul roads, and lower impact skidding equipment. Full implementation would reduce logging emissions by 44% (366 Tg CO2 year−1) and deliver 4% of the nationally determined contributions to the Paris Climate Agreement from tropical countries, while maintaining timber supplies.",

      "abstract": "This paper applies a stochastic viability approach to a tropical small-scale fishery, offering a theoretical and empirical example of ecosystem-based fishery management approach that accounts for food security. The model integrates multi-species, multi-fleet and uncertainty as well as profitability, food production, and demographic growth. It is calibrated over the period 2006–2010 using monthly catch and effort data from the French Guiana's coastal fishery, involving thirteen species and four fleets. Using projections at the horizon 2040, different management strategies and scenarios are compared from a viability viewpoint, thus accounting for biodiversity preservation, fleet profitability and food security. The analysis shows that under certain conditions, viable options can be identified which allow fishing intensity and production to be increased to respond to food security requirements but with minimum impacts on the marine resources.",

      "abstract": "Production of French Polynesia's black pearls is entirely dependent on oceanic conditions. Yet, conditions are changing due to climate change. This research evaluates the potential economic consequences of increased seawater temperature on black pearl production. A stochastic-dynamic bioeconomic simulation simulated the growth of oysters and pearl quality under current and projected seawater temperatures in 2035 in the Northern Tuamotu Archipelago. Production strategies, including grafting intensity, grafting timeframe, and overall pearl quality distribution were included in the simulation to identify production strategies which maximized net present value (NPV) over ten-years. Across all simulated management scenarios, production occurring under projected seawater temperatures resulted in an average decline of 29.1% in expected NPV. Overall, the change in expected NPV stemmed from a decline in the quantity of pearls produced, decline in the quality of pearls produced, and an increase in time between production stages. The optimal production strategy for current and projected seawater temperatures across all management scenarios was to graft a whole cohort of oysters in December with the best possible pearl quality distribution. However, with production occurring with other pearl quality distributions, optimal grafting timeframe and intensity differs between temperature regimes. Aligning production strategies with seawater temperatures can ameliorate economic losses.",

      "abstract": "Tropical forests are facing threats that may affect the dynamics of seed dispersers which participate in the forest regeneration. To implement appropriate conservation programs, it appears necessary to monitor seed dispersers and to estimate their response to local changes. Here, we used non-invasive ecoacoustic methods to monitor the activity of a canopy bird, the White-throated toucan, Ramphastos tucanus, a major seed disperser and flagship species of the Amazonian forest. We deployed nine acoustic recorders over 29 days along a road that connects French Guiana to Brazil. We used template matching to automatically detect the vocalizations of R. tucanus. This method, which can easily be repeated with limited human expertise, detected 1748 recordings with R. tucanus vocalizations. A GLMM analysis was applied to test for a possible effect of habitat type and human activity, while accounting for time of the day and rainfall. The number of vocalizations varied according to time of the day with peaks at dawn and dusk. The number of vocalizations did not differ significantly among sites, they were not affected by habitat type, and they were only marginally influenced by human activity. These results indicate that the vocal activity of a key conservation species can be monitored automatically in a non-invasive way. The species targeted, R. tucanus, does not seem to be significantly impacted by the road and local human activity. This might be related to the mobility of the species, which can easily cross the road, as well as low local forestry pressure.",

      "abstract": "The remineralization of organic carbon (OC) in marine sediments has crucial implications for global carbon cycling and climate change. However, OC turnover rates differ significantly owing to complex spatiotemporal variations in sediment depositional conditions. This review discusses the dominant methodologies through laboratory or in situ methods to measure oxygen consumption or dissolved inorganic carbon production rates to assess OC remineralization rates. The influencing factors in marine sediments are briefly described, including characteristics of OC interactions with the sediment matrix, redox effect, temperature, and biotic activities. Lastly, we provide a comparison of the OC remineralization rates among near-shore (0–50 m), continental shelf and slope (50–2000 m), deep sea (2000–6000 m), and trench (>6000 m) sediments. The remineralization rates generally decreased with distance from the continent, excluding the trench region. While conditions such as redox oscillation, nutrient input, and temperature were severely influenced by global warming and human activities on large scales, reactions between OC and degradation functional genes of microorganisms helped to reveal the microbial scale of sedimentary OC remineralization. Thus, it is pivotal to understand both the processes of OC remineralization and the underlying mechanisms in marine sediments.",

      "abstract": "Tree mode of death provides insights as to why soil and topography explain only about 25% of the spatial variation in tree mortality in Central Amazonia, and permit predictions about what types of mortality are most probable under climate change. We studied tree mortality by mode of death in 72 1-ha permanent plots spanning 64km2 of tropical moist forest in Reserva Ducke, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil. Plots were re-censused twice (2003–2005 and 2005–2008). Tree mode of death was assigned for trees ⩾4cm dbh as standing, uprooted or snapped. We also recorded whether trees died alone or were pushed over by treefalls. Standing death was predominant, representing 54% of deaths of trees with dbh⩾10cm, followed by snapping (26%) and uprooting (14%). Trees that fell alone represented 25% of deaths, while 16% were pushed over. Most small fallen dead trees (4⩽dbh<30cm) were pushed over by other trees, while most large dead trees (dbh⩾30cm) died alone. Standing mortality was weakly related to soil and topography, but 20% of variation in uprooted mortality and 11% in snapped mortality of trees with dbh⩾10cm was explained by soil and topography. The variation in mortality explained for small trees (18% for uprooted mortality and 13% for snapped mortality) was higher than for large trees (14% for mortality by snapping only). In spite of little variation in mortality associated directly with soil and slope, analyses assessing the effect of topographic categories (plateaux, slope, and valley) on tree mortality detected higher differences, even though causal factors remain unidentified because topographic position may encompass both topographic and soil properties. There was an increase from the first to the second census interval in the effects associated with soil and topography on tree mortality by uprooting and snapping, and this was likely due to storms, which led to a disproportional increase in tree mortality for these tree modes of death. Presently, uprooting and snapping mortality are not dominant and the use of soil and topographic variables for modeling of tree mortality is therefore limited. However, under predicted climate-change scenarios of higher frequency of extreme storms, soil and topography may become more useful to improve estimates of tree mortality and biomass losses over large areas in Amazonia.",

      "abstract": "The ongoing coronavirus disease 19s pandemic has yet again demonstrated the importance of the human-animal interface in the emergence of zoonotic diseases, and in particular the role of wildlife and livestock species as potential hosts and virus reservoirs. As most diseases emerge out of the human-animal interface, a better understanding of the specific drivers and mechanisms involved is crucial to prepare for future disease outbreaks. Interactions between wildlife and livestock systems contribute to the emergence of zoonotic diseases, especially in the face of globalization, habitat fragmentation and destruction and climate change. As several groups of viruses and bacteria are more likely to emerge, we focus on pathogenic viruses of the Bunyavirales, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, and Paramyxoviridae, as well as bacterial species including Mycobacterium sp., Brucella sp., Bacillus anthracis and Coxiella burnetii. Noteworthy, it was difficult to predict the drivers of disease emergence in the past, even for well-known pathogens. Thus, an improved surveillance in hotspot areas and the availability of fast, effective, and adaptable control measures would definitely contribute to preparedness.

The results of this case study illustrate the cost effectiveness of alternative land-use options that reduce deforestation and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This analysis demonstrates that using Guyana's rainforests for climate change mitigation can generate equivalent revenue to that of conventional large-scale logging without detrimental environmental impacts. At a 12% discount rate, the break-even price for carbon is estimated to be about US$ 0.20/tC. This estimate falls toward the low range of carbon prices for existing carbon offset projects that avoid deforestation.",

      "abstract": "Drought events may induce mangrove mortality and dieback events worldwide as a result of climate extremes. As mangroves sequester large quantities of carbon, quantifying the losses of these stocks following climate disturbances may guide wetland governance strategies globally. In Southeast Brazil, we determined the total ecosystem carbon stocks (TECS) of pristine mangroves that were up to 1851 Mg of carbon per hectare (Mg C ha−1), which are the highest stocks measured from South American and raising estimates of Brazil's mangrove TECS to 0.52 Pg C. A mangrove mortality event in the same estuary resulted in a 14.6 % decrease in TECS (270.5 Mg C ha−1) and loss of 20 % of mangrove soil carbon within less than 2-years. Carbon dioxide emissions from this impact were 992.8 Mg CO2e ha−1, which are slightly lower than emissions from land use disturbances on mangroves worldwide. Our results suggest that climate effects on mangroves can become significant sources of greenhouse gases globally.",

In this extensive approach, the Sr and Mg contents are well correlated and both are partly related to agricultural and weathering inputs. The relationship between Sr-isotope and Mg/Sr ratios allows definition of the relative impact on surface and groundwater of processes occurring in the Critical Zone, mainly rain, agricultural practices and water-rock interactions.",

Impacts from sea level rise, ocean acidification, increases in ocean temperature, potential collapse of the thermohaline circulation; failure of the South Asia monsoon; the melting of sea ice, the Greenland Ice Sheet and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet; changes in water availability; and Amazonia forest dieback, are considered. The review highlights that while a number of uncertainties remain in understanding, there is evidence to suggest that climate change may have already affected some ecosystem services. Furthermore, there is considerable evidence to show that future climate change could have impacts on biodiversity, as well as secondary impacts on issues important to human society, including; habitability; land productivity and food security; water security; and potential economic impacts.",

      "abstract": "In democracies around the world, societies have demonstrated that elections can have major consequences for the environment. In Colombia, the 2022 presidential elections will take place at a time when progress towards peace has stalled and socioeconomic, security, and environmental conditions have deteriorated. The recent declines in these conditions largely coincide with the change of government after the 2018 elections, and the associated rise to power of a party that boycotted the peace negotiations from the beginning. These indicators suggest that 2018 marked the end of a decade of improvements in safety, wealth, and equality—societal factors that can interact with the environment in multiple ways. A spike in assassinations of land and environmental defenders in 2019 and 2020 made Colombia one of the most dangerous places in the world for environmentalists. With the 2022 presidential election, Colombians will once again decide who will govern the country and what new social, economic, and environmental policies will be implemented. In preparation for elections like this, we believe that it is important for scientists with relevant backgrounds to highlight relationships between political events and the environment, to enrich the political debate, help prioritize public resources, and inform policy-making. Here, we provide a multidisciplinary analysis of different socioeconomic and environmental trends that can help inform the public and decision-makers. We intend for this analysis to be useful not only in Colombia, but also to other societies under similar situations, managing biodiversity-rich ecosystems in socio-political environments of increasing violence, poverty, and inequality.",

The 2012 weather extreme which occurred in the USA reduced US and global maize production by 29% compared to trend; maize consumption in the country decreased by 5% only and this resulted in less surplus maize for exports from the largest maize exporter in the world. Global maize production decreased by 6% compared to trend. The decrease in global maize production coupled with a reduction in the volume of global maize exports worsened food insecurity in eastern Africa, the Caribbean and Central America and India. The effects of the weather extreme on global food security would be worse, if the latter were to occur under climate change in 2050, assuming no climate change adaptation worldwide over the years. In addition, the hardest-hit regions would remain the same, whether the weather extreme occurs in 2012 instead of 2050: Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), South Asia and the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region. However, sustained growth in per capita income across world economies between 2000 and 2050 would allow few countries in SSA and the LAC region to virtually eliminate hunger within their borders. In these countries, per capita income would be high enough by 2050 to completely offset the negative effect of the weather extreme. The study results are also consistent with USDA׳s estimates on US and global maize production and consumption in 2012 after the weather extreme. Some discrepancy is found on the volume of global maize trade; this implies that the bio-economic model likely overestimates the effect of the weather extreme on food insecurity. However, the trends from the analysis are likely to be valid. Further research would involve using a CGE model that can capture the net effects of weather extremes.",

      "abstract": "This chapter reviews the available paleoecological information on Pantepui since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in order to reconstruct the ecological dynamics that have led to the present configuration of plant communities and to unravel the potential environmental drivers involved, with emphasis on regional climate changes and fire. To date, no LGM sediments have been retrieved atop the tepuis, so the vegetation of these summits during the last glaciation remains unknown. Some lowland records suggest that cold LGM climates favored downward migration of temperature-sensitive tepuian species, which drove changes in the taxonomic composition of lowland forests. The available paleoecological record of Pantepui ranges from the early Holocene to the present. These records show two contrasting situations. Some tepui summits exhibit a long vegetation constancy extending back to the mid-Holocene, whereas others document significant changes in sensitive species that have been associated with regional climatic events, such as the Holocene Thermal Maximum, the latitudinal migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, the El Niño Southern Oscillation variability, or recent climatic shifts such as the Medieval Climatic Anomaly or the Little Ice Age. This has been interpreted in terms of the site’s sensitivity, and it has been recommended to obtain past records, preferably on elevational ecotones, where vertical migrations of species are more easily detected. During the last millennium, fire, most probably of anthropogenic origin and likely originating on the surrounding uplands, has been a major driver of vegetation change on some tepuis.",

      "abstract": "Climate change models predict sea level rise and increased intensity of storms and hurricanes in tropical sea turtle nesting areas. These factors could significantly increase beach inundation and erosion, thus affecting water content of sea turtle nesting beaches. Here, we conducted a field and laboratory study of how sand water content is related to embryonic development and hatching success of leatherback turtle nests. Moreover, we have experimentally incubated eggs of this species in beach sand under standardized conditions, but at different realistic levels of sand water content, varying from 1% to 12%. On the beaches, females nested from the intertidal zone to the lower part of the sand vegetation dunes, where nests were exposed to a wide range of sand water contents that ranged from 0.8% to 22%. However, both field and experimental studies revealed a strong negative correlation between sand water content and emergence success (field study: r=−0.73, P<0.0001; experiment: r=−0.84, P<0.0001). In the field, mean emergence success varied from 0% for the wettest nests to 64% for the driest ones. Nests in wet sand suffered higher mortality, primarily in the earlier developmental stages. Eggs incubated in the driest sand lost mass, but there were no significant effects on hatchling mass or run speed compared to eggs that gained water during incubation. However, hatchling straight carapace length (SCL) was greater in eggs from the driest treatment. The results of the present study inform management of change under future climate change sea level rise scenarios, suggesting that leatherback turtle nesting success should be expected to decrease.",

      "abstract": "The efficiency of carbon (C) sequestration and its long-term storage by the mangroves and other shallow coastal habitats (like seagrass, tidal marsh, macroalgae) has been well recognized in mitigating climate change. Sediment is the largest reservoir of this sequestered C, also known as “blue C.” Blue C can be exported from sediment to the coastal water as dissolved or particulate form, or degraded to CO2 and release in the atmosphere, or it can be buried within the sediment for centuries to millennia. Other than discussing sedimentary C exchange processes in mangroves, we also reviewed current global database of blue C and identified South Asian countries as poor inventory despite a significant coverage (6.5%) and presence of world's largest deltaic mangrove, the Sundarbans (~10,000km2). From data synthesis, blue C stock in South Asian mangroves is overall low compared to the neighboring South East (SE) Asian mangroves, that is due to less C% in sediment, low forest productivity, and nutrient limitation in the sediment. Application of stable isotopes, molecular biomarkers have been discussed to delineate sources of organic carbon (OC) in the sediment. Potential algal sources are recognized to contribute to sedimentary OC in southeastern India and Bangladesh mangroves, that could also explain their low C%, contrast to C-rich SE Asian mangroves where OC is largely of terrigenous origin. In the present discussion, C budget for the Indian Sundarbans has been revisited, that still warrants further investigations on biogeochemical sink processes (some aspects like benthic faunal production, fine root production, lithogenous or biogenous carbonate production, night-time benthic respiration). Lastly, we discussed on various aspects of blue C research to be undertaken in these mangrove ecosystems in future to fill the current gaps and challenges to develop better policies and how blue C research would help in conserving South Asian mangroves.",

      "abstract": "The term “wilderness” has several dimensions. It is used as a biological descriptor for intact or largely intact areas that have little or no industrial infrastructure and are remote from urban areas. It is also used as a protected area classification for areas corresponding to Category 1b—wilderness areas in IUCN's protected areas classification system. And finally, the term “wilderness” captures human relationships with wild places—from Indigenous Peoples who view wilderness not as a thing apart but as “home” to sacred natural sites to areas where urban populations recreate. Crucially, wilderness areas are not places where people are excluded, but rather places where certain human activities are restricted or not allowed. Wilderness areas around the world are shrinking quickly and are increasingly rare, and conservation of Earth's remaining wilderness is urgently needed: they are indispensable for biodiversity conservation, for climate change mitigation and adaptation, for freshwater quality—and many other ecosystem services—and for the protection of cultural integrity and biocultural landscapes as well as livelihoods.",

      "abstract": "The colonization of the epiphytic niche of Neotropical forest canopies played an important role in orchid’s extraordinary diversification, with rare reversions to the terrestrial habit. To understand the evolutionary context of those reversals, we investigated the diversification of Galeandra, a Neotropical orchid genus which includes epiphytic and terrestrial species. We hypothesized that reversion to the terrestrial habit accompanied the expansion of savannas. To test this hypothesis we generated a comprehensive time-calibrated phylogeny and employed comparative methods. We found that Galeandra originated towards the end of the Miocene in Amazonia. The terrestrial clade originated synchronously with the rise of dry vegetation biomes in the last 5 million years, suggesting that aridification dramatically impacted plant diversification and habits in the Neotropics. Shifts in habit impacted floral spur lengths and geographic range size, but not climatic niche. The longer spurs and narrower ranges characterize epiphytic species, which probably adapted to specialized long-tongued Euglossini bee pollinators inhabiting forested habits. The terrestrial species present variable floral spurs and wider distribution ranges, with evidence of self-pollination, suggesting the loss of specialized pollination system and concomitant range expansion. Our study highlights how climate change impacted habit evolution and associated traits such as mutualistic interactions with pollinators.",

Pantepui aquatic insect fauna is composed of genera that are confined to the nutrient-poor waters of the Guiana Shield together with other widespread genera. The unsuitable habitat among tepuis represents an ecological barrier, which limits faunal interchange among tepuis through adjacent lowlands and uplands. Limited dispersal among tepui summits and habitat shifts from summits to adjacent savannas or vice versa, followed by long-term isolation, have played important roles in species diversification. Therefore a single-tepui endemism is a common phenomenon, although the occurrence of the same species on multiple tepuis has also been recorded. A systematic study of Pantepui aquatic insect taxonomy, distribution, and ecology, as well as the structure of aquatic communities and their ecosystems’ functioning, are necessary in order to elucidate the evolutionary and ecological processes that have formed its aquatic communities.",

      "abstract": "Modeling soil water availability for tropical trees is a prerequisite to predicting the future impact of climate change on tropical forests. In this paper we develop a discrete-time deterministic water balance model adapted to tropical rainforest climates, and we validate it on a large dataset that includes micro-meteorological and soil parameters along a topographic gradient in a lowland forest of French Guiana. The model computes daily water fluxes (rainfall interception, drainage, tree transpiration and soil plus understorey evapotranspiration) and soil water content using three input variables: daily precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and solar radiation. A novel statistical approach is employed that uses Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) soil moisture data to estimate water content at permanent wilting point and at field capacity, and root distribution. Inaccuracy of the TDR probes and other sources of uncertainty are taken into account by model calibration through a Bayesian framework. Model daily output includes relative extractable water, REW, i.e. the daily available water standardized by potential available water. The model succeeds in capturing temporal variations in REW regardless of topographic context. The low Root Mean Square Error of Predictions suggests that the model captures the most important drivers of soil water dynamics, i.e. water refilling and root water extraction. Our model thus provides a useful tool to explore the response of tropical forests to climate scenarios of changing rainfall regime and intensity.",

      "abstract": "There is increasing concern, to what extent production forests in the Neotropics are sustainably managed. The implementation of effective forest management strategies that are ecologically beneficial plays thus a central role to prevent forest degradation. However, to identify effective forest management strategies, there is a need for methods supporting the decision-making process. The main objective of our study is to analyze the mid- and long-term impacts of different management intensities, such as varying the minimum stem diameter of harvestable commercial trees, on the dynamic and structure of a species-rich tropical lowland forest of French Guiana. Therefore, we have applied the management module of a dynamic forest model and analyzed simulation experiments for undisturbed forest growth and selective logging. For the first time we were able to quantify the mean recovery times of multiple ecosystem functions and properties (biomass, gross primary production, leaf area index, Shanon diversity, timber volume) after selective logging. Accordingly, we validated simulation results (biomass, number of trees harvested) of selective logging with forest inventory data from the last 32 years. The forest model reliably reproduces the observed pre-logging biomass, tree-size distribution, and logging intensity (10 trees/ha, 39 m3/ha). In addition, it became clear how strongly management with higher logging intensities influences the forest in the long term: (1) the mean recovery times of the investigated ecosystem functions were significantly extended. With very intensive logging (116 m3/ha), the average recovery time of forest biomass was almost twice as long as in a moderate simulation scenario (tint 138 a, tmod 77 a). Similar patterns were observed for other ecosystem functions, e.g. timber volume (tint 158 a, tmod 62 a). (2) Additionally, the functional composition shifted, as up to 30% pioneer tree species in particular invaded the forest. This innovative use of forest growth models may help in the development of ecologically reasonable forest management strategies.",

Stand structure and species diversity were assessed in 27 sample plots (20 m× 20 m) covering 1.08 ha of forest. A total of 11 species were recorded. Out of them, 7, 6, and 9 species were found in fresh water, moderate, and strong saline zone, respectively. Species dominance in terms of importance value showed Heritiera fomes > Excoecaria agallocha > Bruguiera sexangula > Xylocarpus mekongensis in fresh water zone; H. fomes > E. agallocha > Avicennia officinalis > Ceriops decandra in moderate saline zone. E. agallocha > Sonneratia apetala > H. fomes > C. decandra in strong saline zone. Species diversity decreased from fresh water to strong saline zone. The findings showed a wide range of leaf morphological plasticity of all the parameters within and among saline zones. Leaf index, plasticity index, and specific leaf area were maximum in fresh water zone than of others. The findings of PCA revealed clear evidences of plastic behavior of leaf morphological parameters. Thus, the plasticity of leaf morphology might contribute as an influential biological signs of forthcoming climate change events.",

      "abstract": "This paper undertakes an exploration of the potential application of the Weitzman prioritisation approach to the conservation of plant genetic resources (PGR). Using a case study approach and assuming limited conservation resources, this approach is applied to calculate the maximum diversity which can be conserved based on a clustering of cacao species (Theobroma cacao L.). A conservation budget allocation model applied across a set of ten clusters and nine subclusters of cacao, together with the use of alternative diversity and risk measures, allowed for an evaluation of a range of potential conservation outcomes. Alternative risk measures generally resulted in the allocation of conservation funds to the same priority clusters of cacao (Criollo and Curaray). However, the use of the number of locally common alleles as an alternative to the original Weitzman diversity measure produced a markedly different result, prioritising the Purús cluster in Western Amazonia. The Curaray cluster was highly prioritised under both diversity measures, indicating its distinctiveness relative to both the Criollo and Purús clusters. We conclude that the Weitzman approach can indeed allow diversity comparisons to be made between the outcomes of different PGR conservation strategies, although subjective decisions regarding the choice of diversity and risk measures remain.",

      "abstract": "Scientific information on the shrimp and groundfish resources of the Brazil–Guianas continental shelf has been produced by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism (CRFM), in collaboration with the national governments exploiting the resources, since the early 1970s. In spite of the availability of such information, largely as grey literature, there is limited evidence as to the extent it is being used in fisheries management in Trinidad and Tobago. The flow of information between multiple stakeholders − fishing industry, scientists, fisheries managers, policy makers, and fisheries advisory bodies − was studied based on responses to a survey of key individuals to document each of their roles in the creation, distribution, and use of fisheries information. Content analysis of responses was completed to determine the opportunities and barriers for using scientific information in fisheries management. Salience, credibility, and legitimacy of the information were shadowed by barriers that decreased these attributes. Knowledge about the fishery has increased and technical capabilities have been strengthened through research. At the same time, advances in digital technology have made information more accessible. Yet, the high technical content of fisheries information reduced its usefulness to some stakeholders and formal systems do not exist for distributing or measuring the use and influence of such information in decision making. Communication strategies to promote awareness of the scientific information and aligning scientific information with fisheries policy could increase its use and influence. Institutional support for partnerships and education to encourage stakeholder involvement could also facilitate increased influence of scientific information.",

Freshwater ecosystems are impacted by many stressors with impacts that remain poorly understood. While we know the status and the effects of some stressors on certain fish and invertebrate species, whole ecosystem effects are yet to be understood. We describe the status and general trends of 10 stressors: variation in rainfall due to climate change; changes in forest cover (e.g., logging, deforestation, and afforestation); agriculture and livestock; impervious cover (e.g., urban areas); mining operations; flow regulation; loss of riparian zones and floodplains; overfishing; and the introduction of exotic species. Agriculture, mining, and increase in impervious cover due to urbanization are the major stressors for neotropical freshwater ecosystems. Although information is limited the local extinctions of freshwater populations and the loss of ecosystem functions and services are common and likely to increase given the limited conservation measures applied in the region.",

      "abstract": "The Demerara Plateau, off the French Guiana and Surinam margin, corresponds to a prominent sub-horizontal marginal plateau. The interpretation of a large set of seismic data acquired along the Demerara Plateau and integration with previous seismic stratigraphy and drill studies enables a better understanding of the sedimentary evolution of the outer Demerara marginal plateau. Since the end of the transform activity (late Albian), three sedimentary evolutionary stages have been identified. 1) The Pre-contourite Stage (late Albian to early Miocene) is strongly controlled by the structure of the margin that influences the distribution pattern of post-transform deposits through differential thermal subsidence between transform and divergent segments. 2) The Transitional Stage (middle Miocene to early Pliocene) is expressed as a current-controlled erosive surface resulting from the onset of bottom-current interactions due to the establishment and strengthening of the modern thermohaline circulation that is coeval with the progressive closure of the Isthmus of Panama. 3) The Contourite Stage (middle Pliocene to Holocene) is characterized by the development of a contourite depositional system that is linked to the activity of the North Atlantic Deep Water circulation and by a complex interaction between alongslope and downslope processes. Our study highlights that marginal plateaus might be particularly prone to develop contourite features since they regionally influence ocean current dynamics in guiding and accelerating bottom contour currents. Marginal plateaus should thus be considered as a key target to study bottom current dynamics and paleocirculation patterns.",

      "abstract": "This chapter presents changes in relative sea level (RSL) along tropical coastlines (30°N–30°S). Under current and future global changes, 90% of the coastlines are at risk, facing challenges of rising sea level (SL). Since the last century, scientists have attempted to understand processes governing RSL, to separate variations in absolute SL from those due to vertical land movement, and to discover their links to climate change. Recently developed space technologies provide accurate estimates of ongoing SL changes. Combined with tide gauge records, these new instruments (global positioning system, altimetry, interferometric synthetic aperture radar) offer a new perspective for the science associated with SL and its changes. This chapter reviews the concept of RSL, of RSL hotspots, and describes different RSL measurements. Then, it identifies and maps the hotspots of RSL changes and updates, where possible, previously published estimates of RSL trends. Identification of the RSL hotspots is of paramount importance for climate change mitigation and adaptation in tropical regions.",

      "abstract": "We predict stand basal area (BA) from small footprint LiDAR data in 129 one-ha tropical forest plots across four sites in French Guiana and encompassing a great diversity of forest structures resulting from natural (soil and geological substrate) and anthropogenic effects (unlogged and logged forests). We use predictors extracted from the Canopy Height Model to compare models of varying complexity: single or multiple regressions and nested models that predict BA by independent estimates of stem density and quadratic mean diameter. Direct multiple regression was the most accurate, giving a 9.6% Root Mean Squared Error of Prediction (RMSEP). The magnitude of the various errors introduced during the data collection stage is evaluated and their contribution to MSEP is analyzed. It was found that these errors accounted for less than 10% of model MSEP, suggesting that there is considerable scope for model improvement. Although site-specific models showed lower MSEP than global models, stratification by site may not be the optimal solution. The key to future improvement would appear to lie in a stratification that captures variations in relations between LiDAR and forest structure.",

      "abstract": "The inclusion of managed tropical forests in climate change mitigation has made it important to find the sustainable sweet-spot for timber production, carbon retention, and the quick recovery of both. Here we focus on recovery of aboveground carbon and timber stocks over the first 32years after selective logging with the CELOS Harvest System in Suriname. Our data are from twelve 1-ha permanent sample plots in which growth, survival, and recruitment of trees ≥15cm diameter were monitored between 1978 and 2012. We evaluate plot-level changes in basal area, stem density, aboveground carbon, and timber stock in response to average timber harvests of 15, 23, and 46m3ha−1. We use a linear mixed-effects model in a Bayesian framework to quantify recovery time for aboveground carbon and timber stock, as well as annualized increments for both. Our statistical models accounted for the uncertainty associated with the height and biomass allometries used to estimate aboveground carbon and increased precision of annualized aboveground carbon increments by including data from forty-one plots located elsewhere on the Guiana Shield. The probabilities of aboveground carbon recovery to pre-logging levels 32years after harvests of 15, 23 and 46m3ha−1 were 45%, 40%, and 24%, respectively. Net aboveground carbon increment for logged forests across all harvest intensities was 0.64MgCha−1yr−1, more than twice the rate observed in unlogged forests (0.26MgCha−1yr−1). The probabilities of timber stock recovery at the end of the 32-year period were highest after harvest intensities of 15 and 23m3ha−1 (with 80% probability) and lowest after the harvest of 46m3ha−1 (with 70% probability). Timber stock recovery across all harvest intensities was driven primarily by residual tree growth. Application of the legal cutting limit of 25m3ha−1 will require more than 70 and 40years to recover aboveground carbon and timber stocks, respectively, with 90% probability. Based on the low recruitment rates of the twelve species harvested, the 25year cutting cycle currently implemented in Suriname is too short for long-term timber stock sustainability. We highlight the value of propagating uncertainty from individual tree measurements to statistical predictions of carbon stock recovery. Ultimately, our study reveals the trade-offs that must be made between timber and carbon services as well as the opportunity to use carbon payments to enable longer cutting rotations to capture carbon from forest regrowth.",

      "abstract": "Conservation-related concerns about Pantepui usually pertain to direct human impacts (biopiracy, invader species, fire, contamination, etc.), and little attention has been paid to indirect threats, such as global warming (GW). This chapter summarizes the studies carried out to date aimed at estimating the potential impact of the projected GW by the end of this century on the Pantepui biota, particularly on vascular plants. The main threat seems to be extinction caused by habitat loss due to the impossibility of upward migration on the flat summits of the tepuis. Potential extinction has been estimated on the basis of GW predictions from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) using the altitudinal range shift (ARS) and species–area relationship (SAR) methods. The preliminary results suggest the potential extinction of up to approximately 80% of the vascular flora, including approximately 50% of the Pantepui–endemic species. Several in situ and ex situ protection measures are discussed in an attempt to palliate such eventual biodiversity depletion. The available extinction estimates are preliminary and based on homogeneous responses of all vascular plants to GW, which is not fully realistic but is all that can be done with the available information. Future studies should be aimed at refining extinction estimates, considering the eventual idiosyncratic responses of the different species, such as differential migration rates, phenotypic plasticity, or adaptive ability. However, the main handicap is the lack of autoecological information on Pantepui species and the unfeasibility of conducting such studies due to the bureaucratic impediments related to obtaining sampling permits. It is urgent to circumvent this situation if the biodiversity of Pantepui, one of the very few pristine locations left on our planet, is to be preserved.",

      "abstract": "During the past few decades, commercial silvopastoral systems (SPS) with exotic Eucalyptus (hybrid) trees have become popular in the Brazilian Cerrado (savanna). With the increasing awareness about the role of carbon (C) storage in soils as a climate-change mitigation strategy and the relationship between the nature of soil aggregates and the soil's carbon sequestration potential, it is important to understand the influence of such SPS systems on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage. We studied C content in three aggregate size classes in six land-use systems on Oxisols in Minas Gerais, Brazil. The systems were planted forest, native secondary forest, managed pasture, and three 8-year-old SPS, differing in their tree-planting configurations. Eucalyptus hybrid was the tree in SPS and planted forest treatments, and Urochloa decumbens was the grass in SPS and pasture treatments. From each treatment, replicated soil samples were collected from four depth-classes (0–10, 10–30, 30–60, and 60–100 cm), fractionated by wet sieving into the three aggregate-size classes, 2000 to 250 μm, 250 to 53 μm, and <53 μm size classes representing macroaggregates, microaggregates, and silt + clay, respectively, and their C contents determined. Down to 1 m, total SOC stock values ranged from 260 Mg ha−1 under pasture to 167 Mg ha−1 under native forest, with 174 Mg ha−1 for Eucalyptus plantation and about 195 Mg ha−1 for the three SPS. Compared to the degraded native forest, the pasture system had significantly higher SOC in the whole soil and the aggregate size fractions, especially in the lower soil-depth classes. The lower SOC stock of Eucalyptus hybrid SPS compared to open pasture differs from the general trend of SPS having higher stock. Given that the Cerrado biome is a biodiversity hotspot, the use of native nitrogen-fixing trees, of which there are several, is worth investigating. In addition, the conversion from Eucalyptus monocultures to SPS could be considered as a strategy to increase the SOC stock.",

Forest vulnerability to external factors (e.g. air pollution, acid rain) is widely studied in northern countries, while only a few attempts have investigated crown integrity in the Tropics. The method needs to be generic enough to account for the large number of species and crown shapes encountered in tropical forests. In the present study, we developed and tested a novel field method that estimates crown fragmentation (main branch mortality (MB) and secondary branch mortality (SB)), liana infestation (LI) and crown position (CP) in the canopy. The relationship between crown fragmentation and annual growth rate (agr) was investigated through multiple regression. Six out of eight canopy tree species showed significant growth decline with increasing crown fragmentation. Higher probability of death was also found in trees with severe crown fragmentation. The capacity of such crown assessment to depict tree vitality in a forest stand is discussed along with potential applications in both forest science and management.",

      "abstract": "The Paris Agreement has set a goal to limit the global average temperature rise to within 2°C from the pre-industrial level. This study aims to explore the possible pathways to achieve this challenging goal by using the Global Energy and Environmental Policy Analysis module (GEEPA) of the China's Climate Change Integrated Assessment Model (C3IAM). Results show that a target temperature of 2°C dramatically reduces global CO2 emissions in the future. Under model parameters, by the end of this century, total global CO2 emissions will fall below 5 Gt, and cumulated CO2 emissions will be reduced to less than 1000 Gt. The key to meeting the 2°C target lies in the low-carbon transformation of energy and electricity systems. Implementation of climate policies and technical measures will progressively reduce conventional fossil energy consumption and replace it with low-carbon energy solutions. The electricity structure will gradually shift from dominance by conventional fossil energy to low-carbon energy, and even to zero-carbon electricity generation. We found that emission reduction pathways that include large amounts of fossil fuel power generation with CCS merely relying on subsidies may create higher GDP loss, but also that later penetration of negative emission technology can increase the carbon emission budget in the early stage.",

      "abstract": "Presence of a coastal savanna belt expanding from British Guiana to northeastern Brazil cannot be explained by present-day climate. Using pollen and charcoal analyses on an 11.6 k old sediment core from a coastal depression in the savanna belt near the mouth of the Amazon River we investigated the paleoenvironmental history to shed light on this question. Results indicate that small areas of savanna accompanied by a forest type composed primarily by the genus Micropholis (Sapotaceae) that has no modern analog existed at the beginning of the Holocene. After 11,200 cal yr BP, savanna accompanied by few trees replaced the forest. In depressions swamp forest developed and by ca 10,000 cal yr BP replaced by Mauritia swamps. Between 8500 and 5600 cal yr BP gallery forest (composed mainly of Euphorbiaceae) and swamp forest succeeded the treeless savanna. The modern vegetation with alternating gallery forest and savanna developed after 5600 cal yr BP. We suggest that the early Holocene no-analog forest is a relict of previously more extensive forest under cooler and moister Lateglacial conditions. The early Holocene savanna expansion indicates a drier phase probably related to the shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) towards its northernmost position. The mid-Holocene forest expansion is probably a result of the combined influence of equatorwards shift of ITCZ joining the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ). The ecosystem variability during the last 5600 cal yr BP, formed perhaps under influence of intensified ENSO condition. High charcoal concentrations, especially during the early Holocene, indicate that natural and/or anthropogenic fires may have maintained the savanna. However, our results propose that climate change is the main driving factor for the formation of the coastal savanna in this region. Our results also show that the early Holocene sea level rise established mangroves near the study site until 7500 cal yr BP and promoted swamp formation in depressions, but did not influence the savanna vegetation.",

      "abstract": "Earth system models (ESMs) have been widely used to simulate global terrestrial carbon fluxes, including gross primary production (GPP) and net primary production (NPP). Assessment of such GPP and NPP products can be valuable for understanding the efficacy of certain ESMs in simulating the global carbon cycle and future climate impacts. In this work, we studied the model performance of 22 ESMs participating in the fifth and sixth phases of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5 and CMIP6) by comparing historical GPP and NPP simulations with satellite data from MODIS and further evaluating potential model improvement from CMIP5 to CMIP6. In CMIP6, the average global total GPP and NPP estimated by the 22 ESMs are 16% and 13% higher than MODIS data, respectively. The multi-model ensembles (MME) of the 22 ESMs can fairly reproduce the spatial distribution, zonal distribution and seasonal variations of both GPP and NPP from MODIS. They perform much better in simulating GPP and NPP for grasslands, wetlands, croplands and other biomes than forests. However, there are noticeable differences among individual ESM simulations in terms of overall fluxes, temporal and spatial flux distributions, and fluxes by biome and region. The MME consistently outperforms all individual models in nearly every respect. Even though several ESMs have been improved in CMIP6 relative to CMIP5, there is still much work to be done to improve individual ESM and overall CMIP performance. Future work needs to focus on more comprehensive model mechanisms and parametrizations, higher resolution and more reasonable coupling of land surface schemes and atmospheric/oceanic schemes.",

      "abstract": "Mangrove forests grow in coastal saline environments and, little is known about the stand water use (S) and regulation mechanisms of mangrove forests, particularly in the eastern mangrove group. We measured the xylem sap flow density (SFD) of six tree species for two years in a tropical mangrove forest on Hainan Island, China, which is under a monsoon climate. Bimodal daily SFD patterns were observed in all six species in spring and summer. The sap flow of all species were suppressed in winter strongly and also in spring. The annual water use per tree was positively correlated with diameter at breast height (DBH) (R2 = 0.81–0.89, P < 0.05). By scaling up from individual trees, we found that the S values of two mangrove plots ranged from 269.19 to 357.27 mm y−1 between the two study years, accounting for 18–22% of the annual rainfall. These S values are similar to those of other mangrove and tropical forests with similar stand basal areas. The crown conductance sensitivity (mc) to ln VPD (vapor pressure deficit) was strongly correlated with reference crown conductance (GCref) at 1 kPa VPD across all species. The slope value between mc and GCref divided the six species into two groups, suggesting Bruguiera sexangula, Rhizophora apiculata and Sonneratia alba were isohydric, Excoecaria agallocha, B. s. var. rhymchopetala and Xylocarpus granatum were anisohydric. The results of this study will be useful for modeling ecosystem services of mangrove ecosystems facing climate change.",

      "abstract": "Plant oil is a key commodity in the global economy, particularly for food and bioenergy markets. However, current production practices often impair smallholder livelihoods, cause land use changes, and compete for food production. The neotropical palm Acrocomia aculeata is currently being promoted as a novel sustainable biomass feedstock, particularly for bioenergy, but only little is known about the palm’s ecological requirements. Based on a comprehensive literature and database search for recorded occurrences of A. aculeata in Latin America, we computed an ecological niche modeling to determine the palm’s potential distribution area based on climatic and soil variables. We subsequently considered current land cover and predicted future climate change scenarios to discuss the cultivation potential of A. aculeata within its possible distribution area. The results revealed a large potential to cultivate A. aculeata in Latin America under current abiotic environmental conditions. The two core distribution regions identified were (1) Central America including the Caribbean, northern Colombia and Venezuela, and (2) southern Brazil and eastern Paraguay. A considerable proportion of the medium to highly suitable growing areas were found to be currently used for agricultural production or covered by land types with high conservation and carbon sequestration value. Applying the model under the IPCC’s A2A ‘business as usual’ emission scenario suggested that by 2080 the vast majority of suitable growing areas severely decline in extent or disappear entirely. Our ecological niche modeling thus shows that despite the palm’s high cultivation potential, a sustainable deployment of A. aculeata requires a precautious, evidence-based approach.",

This paper finds that the negative effect of temperature on output in countries with hot climates runs through reduced investment, depressed labor productivity, poorer human health, and lower agricultural and industrial output. We find that hot low-income countries suffer the largest costs. In a median low-income country, aggregate output is about 2 percent lower and investment is about 10 percent lower seven years after a 1 degree increase in average annual temperature. We also find that economic development, in general, helps to shield countries from temperature shocks, with hot regions in high-income countries on average sustaining less economic damage from rising temperatures than hot regions in low-income countries.",

      "abstract": "Globally, mangroves sequester a large amount of carbon into the sediments, although spatial heterogeneity exists owing to a wide variety of local, regional, and global controls. Rapid environmental and climate change, including increasing sea-level rise, global warming, reduced upstream discharge and anthropogenic activities, are predicted to increase salinity in the mangroves, especially in the Bangladesh Sundarbans, thereby disrupting this blue carbon reservoir. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how salinity affects the belowground soil carbon despite the recognised effect on above ground productivity. To address this gap, research was undertaken in the Bangladesh Sundarbans to compare total soil organic carbon (SOC) across three salinity zones and to explore any potential predictive relationships with other physical, chemical properties and vegetation characteristics. Total SOC was significantly higher in the oligohaline zone (74.8 ± 14.9 Mg ha−1), followed by the mesohaline (59.3 ± 15.8 Mg ha−1), and polyhaline zone (48.3 ± 10.3 Mg ha−1) (ANOVA, F2, 500 = 118.9, p < 0.001). At all sites, the topmost 10 cm of soil contained higher SOC density than the bottom depths (ANOVA, F3, 500 = 30.1, p < 0.001). On average, Bruguiera sp. stand holds the maximum SOC measured, followed by two pioneer species Sonneratia apetala and Avicennia sp. Multiple regression results indicated that soil salinity, organic C:N and tree diameter were the best predictor for the variability of the SOC in the Sundarbans (R2 = 0.62). Despite lower carbon in the soil, the study highlights that the conservation priorities and low deforestation rate have led to less CO2 emissions than most sediment carbon-rich mangroves in the world. The study also emphasised the importance of spatial conservation planning to safeguard the soil carbon-rich zones in the Bangladesh Sundarbans from anthropogenic tourism and development activities to support climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.",

      "abstract": "Global timber demands have penetrated vast tracts of tropical rainforest, with selective logging the most powerful driver of human disturbance within these ecosystems. We review the consequences of timber harvesting on rainforest ecosystems, from individual species through to biological communities. We also investigate the benefits that forest-dwelling communities and wider society can derive from well-managed production forests. Selectively logged forests maintain a wide array of ecosystem services, and orders of magnitude higher levels of biodiversity and carbon storage than the agricultural lands that often imperil them. To unlock the full potential of logged forests in conserving biodiversity, tackling climate change and delivering ecosystem services into the Anthropocene will require several major transitions. These include a pantropical shift towards more environmentally sensitive logging practises, the fostering of new norms in tropical forestry based around long-term forest management, as well as coordinated efforts to limit the negative effects of logging roads, illegal logging and climate change. We discuss potential incentive and enforcement-based mechanisms for precipitating such transitions and highlight key avenues for future enquiry. Research frontiers include determining how best to spatially design logging operations to limit environmental impacts, quantifying the costs and benefits of post-logging activities aimed at recovering logged forest values, and investigating the role of concession licence structures in spawning sustainable forest management. Given their spatial dominance and high conservation value, lofty planetary goals to limit climate change and global biodiversity declines cannot be achieved unless selectively logged tropical forests take a central role in emerging conservation and emissions-reducing agendas.",

      "abstract": "The North Brazil Shelf is a Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) that extends from the Caribbean Sea, in Central America, to the Parnaiba River in Brazil, and includes six countries. The area is dominated by the runoff of large rivers, including the Amazon and Orinoco, and by the intense disturbance of sediment transport, tides and currents. The sea bed is formed mainly by mud in shallow water, and by sand, mud, and gravel in deeper water. In terms of its biological productivity, this LME can be considered oligotrophic, with stratified habitats. The main source of nutrients of the euphotic layer is the local rivers and mangroves. Primary production has been limited by light and rising temperatures in recent years, factors associated with a decrease in marine primary productivity. However, the benthic fauna is very rich and unique, but poorly known. More than 500 fish species have been recorded in this LME. Demersal fish and shrimp are the main fishery resources in coastal and continental shelf waters. Fisheries account for more than 600 million USD a year with a considerable diversity of methods and scales ranging from very small to industrial. Seafood consumption is moderate to high in the local countries. Climate changes, dam building, deforestation, pollution, overfishing, tourism and aquaculture are the main threats to ecosystem productivity and habitat quality. Socioeconomic data are scant for this LME. Development is concentrated near the cities and mouths of rivers. Traditional communities in the coastal areas are culturally diverse, but invariably characterized by very low socioeconomic conditions. The Gross Domestic Product of the local countries ranges from 7,500 USD per capita in Guyana to 32,600 USD per capita in Trinidad and Tobago. Profound problems of governability are common to all six countries, and mean governance indicators reflect poor performances in all cases. The main issues are an absence of effective rule of law, political stability, and control of corruption. Fisheries are characterized by increasing effort and an absence of sustainability. Most of the fishery stocks are either fully or over exploited. This scenario can only be rectified by investments in marine protected areas and scientific research, as well as the increased participation of fishers in the development and implementation of management strategies and regulations.",

      "abstract": "The western tropical Atlantic plays an important role in the interhemispheric redistribution of heat during millennial-scale changes in the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The proper evaluation of this role depends on a clear understanding of sea surface temperature (SST) variations during AMOC slowdown periods like Heinrich Stadials (HS) in the western tropical Atlantic. However, published SST records from the western tropical Atlantic between ca. 4°S and 7°N show inconsistencies that are apparently related to the employed temperature proxy (i.e., Mg/Ca versus alkenone unsaturation index U37k′). In general, while Mg/Ca values indicate warming during Heinrich Stadials, U37k′ values show cooling. To assess this issue, we sampled core GeoB16224-1 retrieved off French Guiana (i.e., 6°39.38′N) and reconstructed water temperatures at high resolution using Mg/Ca on the foraminifera species Globigerinoides ruber, U37k′, TEX86 and modern analogue technique (MAT) transfer functions using planktonic foraminifera assemblages calibrated for 50 m water depth. Our results show that Mg/Ca and TEX86 values recorded an increase in SST related to AMOC slowdown. Conversely, U37k′ and MAT values registered a decrease in temperatures during HS3 and HS1. Our U37k′ and Mg/Ca results thus confirm the previously reported inconsistency for the period between 48–13 cal ka BP. We suggest that several non-thermal physiological effects probably imparted a negative temperature bias on the U37k′ temperatures during Heinrich Stadials. However, MAT-based temperatures show similar variability with U37k′-based temperatures. Hence, we also suggest that during severe slowdown periods of the AMOC, a steeper meridional temperature gradient together with a southward shift of the Intertropical Convergent Zone produced not only an increase in SST but also a stronger upper water column stratification and a shoaling of the thermocline, decreasing subsurface temperatures. Our new high resolution temperature records allow a better characterization of the thermal response of the upper water column in the tropical western Atlantic to slowdown events of the AMOC, reconciling previously discrepant records.",

The impact of climate change could increase the mortality of tropical forests and decrease their ability to store atmospheric carbon dioxide. Efforts to model the forest dynamics in these regions are hindered by the lack of ground measurements and the spatial-temporal overlap of function management processes. Some of the models developed attempt to show the environment’s influence on forest dynamics, particularly by studying the capacity for canopy deformation (plasticity of the crown), as explained in Purves et al. The models allow us to better understand the development of intertree competition, the capacity of species to adapt to changes and how the forest functions as a whole.",

      "abstract": "The interest in quantifying rare species has been increasing, but less attention has been paid to analysing their conservation status. Here, we used the Rabinowitz method based on geographical range, habitat specificity and population size to classify 2,203 tree species of South American savannas (SAS). We considered species with narrow (stenochoric) or wide (eurychoric) geographic range respectively occurring in up to 10% or over of the latitudinal belts in the SAS, specialist (stenoecious) or generalist (euryoecious) species occurring in one or more ecoregions, respectively, and locally scarce or abundant populations of species with low or high numbers of records within a grid cell of 1° latitude by 1° longitude, respectively. We then quantified species which only occur inside protected areas (PAs), in and outside PAs, or only outside PAs. Of the 2,203 species, 49.25% were rare, 40.35% stenochoric, 14.12% stenoecious and 56.15% had a scarce population. The Cerrado (433) followed by Caatinga (259), Campos Rupestres montane savanna (256), Bahia interior forests (189) and Guiana savanna (154) had the highest number of rare species. Only 6.44% species only occurred inside PAs, 83.79% in and outside PAs and 9.75% only outside PAs. Unprotected species are mostly geographically restricted with ecoregion specialists, and have small population sizes. The number of protected species are is positively correlated with the number of records within them. The establishment of PAs should focus on both core and disjunct savannas to encompass all ecoregions in order to ensure the conservation of species and the range of evolutionary processes in SAS.",

      "abstract": "Changes in the life cycle of organisms (i.e. phenology) are one of the most widely used early-warning indicators of climate change, yet this remains poorly understood throughout the tropics. We exhaustively reviewed any published and unpublished study on fruiting phenology carried out at the community level in the American tropics and subtropics (latitudinal range: 26°N–26°S) to (1) provide a comprehensive overview of the current status of fruiting phenology research throughout the Neotropics; (2) unravel the climatic factors that have been widely reported as drivers of fruiting phenology; and (3) provide a preliminary assessment of the potential phenological responses of plants under future climatic scenarios. Despite the large number of phenological datasets uncovered (218), our review shows that their geographic distribution is very uneven and insufficient for the large surface of the Neotropics (~1 dataset per ~78,000km2). Phenological research is concentrated in few areas with many studies (state of São Paulo, Brazil, and Costa Rica), whereas vast regions elsewhere are entirely unstudied. Sampling effort in fruiting phenology studies was generally low: the majority of datasets targeted fewer than 100 plant species (71%), lasted 2years or less (72%), and only 10.4% monitored >15 individuals per species. We uncovered only 10 sites with ten or more years of phenological monitoring. The ratio of numbers of species sampled to overall estimates of plant species richness was wholly insufficient for highly diverse vegetation types such as tropical rainforest, seasonal forest and cerrado, and only slightly more robust for less diverse vegetation types, such as deserts, arid shrublands and open grassy savannas. Most plausible drivers of phenology extracted from these datasets were environmental (78.5%), whereas biotic drivers were rare (6%). Among climatic factors, rainfall was explicitly included in 73.4% of cases, followed by air temperature (19.3%). Other environmental cues such as water level (6%), solar radiation or photoperiod (3.2%), and ENSO events (1.4%) were rarely addressed. In addition, drivers were analyzed statistically in only 38% of datasets and techniques were basically correlative, with only 4.8% of studies including any consideration of the inherently autocorrelated character of phenological time series. Fruiting peaks were significantly more often reported during the rainy season both in rainforests and cerrado woodlands, which is at odds with the relatively aseasonal character of the former vegetation type. Given that climatic models predict harsh future conditions for the tropics, we urgently need to determine the magnitude of changes in plant reproductive phenology and distinguish those from cyclical oscillations. Long-term monitoring and herbarium data are therefore key for detecting these trends. Our review shows that the unevenness in geographic distribution of studies, and diversity of sampling methods, vegetation types, and research motivation hinder the emergence of clear general phenological patterns and drivers for the Neotropics. We therefore call for prioritizing research in unexplored areas, and improving the quantitative component and statistical design of reproductive phenology studies to enhance our predictions of climate change impacts on tropical plants and animals.",

They circulate in nature between arthropod vectors and vertebrate hosts. Infection of susceptible human hosts leads to harmful developmental and neurological manifestations. Arboviruses have caused recent outbreaks with significant public health implications, such as the Zika virus outbreak in the western hemisphere which caused fetal abnormalities in some infected pregnant women, or Eastern Equine Encephalitis which caused 15 deaths in 2019. This review discusses several arboviral infections and their clinical manifestations while highlighting the importance of laboratory diagnostics to detect infections and current attempts at vaccine development. The ability to accurately diagnose an arbovirus infection is critical for initiating a timely response to infections in order to improve patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Temperature increases can impact biodiversity and predicting their effects is one of the main challenges facing global climate-change research. Ectotherms are sensitive to temperature change and, although predictions indicate that tropical species are highly vulnerable to global warming, they remain one of the least studied groups with respect to the extent of physiological variation and local extinction risks. We model the extinction risks for a tropical heliothermic teiid lizard (Kentropyx calcarata) integrating previously obtained information on intraspecific phylogeographic structure, eco-physiological traits and contemporary species distributions in the Amazon rainforest and its ecotone to the Cerrado savannah. We also investigated how thermal-biology traits vary throughout the species' geographic range and the consequences of such variation for lineage vulnerability. We show substantial variation in thermal tolerance of individuals among thermally distinct sites. Thermal critical limits were highly correlated with operative environmental temperatures. Our physiological/climatic model predicted relative extinction risks for local populations within clades of K. calcarata for 2050 ranging between 26.1% and 70.8%, while for 2070, extinction risks ranged from 52.8% to 92.8%. Our results support the hypothesis that tropical-lizard taxa are at high risk of local extinction caused by increasing temperatures. However, the thermo-physiological differences found across the species' distribution suggest that local adaptation may allow persistence of this tropical ectotherm in global warming scenarios. These results will serve as basis to further research to investigate the strength of local adaptation to climate change. Persistence of Kentropyx calcarata also depends on forest preservation, but the Amazon rainforest is currently under high deforestation rates. We argue that higher conservation priority is necessary so the Amazon rainforest can fulfill its capacity to absorb the impacts of temperature increase on tropical ectotherms during climate change.",

Degraded ecosystems can affect water quality and availability, and cause a decrease in food production, climatic instability, poor protection against natural hazards (e.g., floods and storms), and loss of natural landscapes for aesthetic enjoyment. However, the most conspicuous and well-understood risks to health are those related to the infectious and parasitic diseases, especially those endemic in the tropical regions. The main driving forces responsible for ecosystem change today are the economic activities implemented to provide basic materials for livelihoods, such as a agriculture and animal husbandry, materials for construction (e.g., logging), and the provision of energy and water (e.g., dam building). Impacts of climate change also pose a new threat to ecosystems. These changes are taking place in a more rapid and intensive form in developing countries in the tropics.",

      "abstract": "Fire is used in the management of pastures, renewal and expansion of areas, and agricultural activities in South America (SA). The objectives of this study were: i) to identify the countries and regions with the highest number of fire foci in SA, and ii) to evaluate the spatial dynamics of fire foci based on the Meteorological Fire Danger Index (MFDI) and future scenarios through numerical simulations. Fire foci time series comprised 21 years (1998–2018) from the BDQueimadas database. Cluster Analysis (CA), descriptive and exploratory statistics were employed. Fire foci maps for SA were made in 10-km pixel dimensions. MFDI was used to assess fire danger via SPEEDY (Simplified Parametrizations, primitivE-Equation DYnamics) model simulations. Three simulations were performed: control scenario (1980–2015), RCP2.6 scenario (optimistic - 2016 and 2050), and RCP8.5 scenario (pessimistic - 2015 and 2050). Regionally, three homogeneous groups of fire foci (G1, G2 and G3) and one atypical (NA - Not Grouped) were identified for Brazil via CA. The highest fire foci occurred in Brazil (62.72%), followed by Bolivia (9.03%), Argentina (8.28%), Venezuela (6.11%), Paraguay (5.94%), and Colombia (3.87%), respectively. The highest density of fire foci occurred in the MATOPIBA region, the confluence of Maranhão, Tocantins, Piauí, and Bahia, - (agricultural frontier), and also in the Cerrado-Amazon transition and the states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul in Brazil, followed by Paraguay, Bolivia, Venezuela, and Argentina. The countries and regions of Brazil do not change, only intensify from year to year, and such fire foci variability may be associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases. The control scenario identified in east-central Brazil, western Bolivia, Paraguay, and northern Argentina. The optimistic scenario showed an improvement in some countries and a worsening in the territorial distribution in Brazil, Venezuela, and Colombia. The pessimistic scenario identified increased degradation compared to the previous scenarios in almost all SA countries.",

      "abstract": "Tropical forests harbor the greatest terrestrial biodiversity and provide various ecosystem services. The increase of human activities on these forests, among which logging, makes the conservation of biodiversity and associated services strongly dependent on the sustainability of these activities. However the indicators commonly used to assess the impact of forest exploitation, namely species richness and biomass, provide a limited understanding of their sustainability. Here, we assessed the sustainability of common forest exploitation in the Guiana Shield studying the recovery of two ecosystem services i.e. carbon storage and wood stock, and an ecosystem function i.e. seed dispersal by animals. Specifically, we compared total and commercial biomass, as well as functional composition in seed size of animal-dispersed species in replicated forest plots before and 27 years after exploitation. Species richness is also studied to allow comparison. While species richness was not affected by forest exploitation, total and commercial biomass as well as seed size of animal-dispersed species decreased 27 years after exploitation, similarly to forests affected by hunting. These results show that ecosystem services and function likely did not recover even at the lowest intensity of forest exploitation studied, questioning the sustainability of the most common rotation-cycle duration applied in the tropics.",

      "abstract": "The rainforests of the Neotropics shelter a vast diversity of plant, animal and microscopic species that provide critical ecosystem goods and services for both local and worldwide populations. These environments face a major crisis due to increased deforestation, pollution, and climate change, emphasizing the need for more effective conservation efforts. The adequate monitoring of these ecosystems has proven a complex and time consuming endeavour, which depends on ever dwindling taxonomic expertise. To date, many species remain undiscovered, let alone described, with otherwise limited information regarding known species population distributions and densities. Overcoming these knowledge shortfalls and practical limitations is becoming increasingly possible through techniques based on environmental DNA (eDNA), i.e., DNA that can be obtained from environmental samples (e.g. tissues, soil, sediment, water, etc.). When coupled with high-throughput sequencing, these techniques now enable realistic, cost-effective, and standardisable biodiversity assessments. This opens up enormous opportunities for advancing our understanding of complex and species-rich tropical communities, but also in facilitating large-scale biomonitoring programs in the neotropics. In this review, we provide a brief introduction to eDNA methods, and an overview of their current and potential uses in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems of neotropical rainforests. We also discuss the limits and challenges of these methods for our understanding and monitoring of biodiversity, as well as future research and applied perspectives of these techniques in neotropical rainforests, and beyond.",

      "abstract": "This essay examines a basic premise of geomorphology, namely that landforms and land-forming processes reflect interactions between Earth′s tectonic framework and its atmospheric canopy. Five themes are developed. First, tectonism and tectonic change are outlined in terms of changing tectonic concepts, plate mechanics, continental interiors (cratons, platform covers), and continental margins (passive, active). Second, climate forcing is reviewed by defining weather and climate, early notions of climate change, and probable causes of climate change. Climates change through time in response to several interactive forces: those external to Earth, those related to Earth's orbital relations with the Sun, and those internal to the Earth system among which tectonism profoundly alters the playing field for climate and geomorphic processes. Third, the spatial implications for geomorphology of changing tectonic and climate forcing are viewed in the context of latitude and location, continentality and oceanicity, ocean gateways and land corridors, continental elevation and relief barriers, and vegetation cover. Fourth, prefaced by a discussion of the nature and rate of change, the temporal implications for geomorphology of tectonic and climate change over the past 300 million years are evaluated. Eight topics are discussed: the Pangea supercontinent, opening of the Atlantic Ocean and Tethys, opening of the Southern Ocean, uplift of North America's Western Cordillera, uplift of the Andes, uplift of the Eurasian Cordillera and Tethys closure, closure of the Central American isthmus, and volcanism. Last, three geomorphic feedbacks that affect tectonism and climate are discussed: denudation, sedimentation, and isostasy; biogeochemical cycling; and relative sea-level change.",

      "abstract": "Coastal wetlands have been proposed as highly threatened by the ongoing and future climatic change, including projected sea-level changes as an additional forcing factor compared to more inland locations. The limited knowledge generated to date in this topic has been primarily focused on those areas attaining a high population density, and rarely deals with long-term (>50 years) dynamics. Here we present the first Holocene palaeoecological study carried in the Orinoco Delta, in NE Venezuela. The record presented here contains sediments from the last 6200 years and is located in a river-shore swamp dominated by the palm Mauritia flexuosa. Current human occupation is almost restricted to small settlements of the Warao indigenous culture, closely related to the use of M. flexuosa and other palm species present in the zone. The results show the occurrence of three well-distinguished palynological zones: (i) from 6200 to 5200 cal yr BP, characterised by mixed rainforest and other taxa related to salinity (coastal-like), low (negative) values of magnetic susceptibility and magnetic grain size, absence of transported clays, and the highest macrocharcoal particles abundance; (ii) from 5200 to 2950 cal yr BP, marked by a replacement of the mangrove-like vegetation by a more inland mixed-swamp forest community with low levels of charcoal, and (iii) from 2950 cal yr BP to present-day, characterised by the establishment of the current vegetation community, dominated by M. flexuosa, and an increasing trend in the charcoal curve since the last 700 years. A combination of regional (climatic changes) and local (sediment ontogeny) has been proposed as the key drivers influencing the vegetation succession recorded. The stabilisation of the sea-level that occurred during the mid-Holocene would have favoured the transgression of the coastal line, with the migration of the coastal-like vegetation seawards. Synchronous to this event, a trend towards drier conditions has been reported in the close Cariaco record, that could have also influenced the vegetation replacement. Between 3800 and 2800 years ago, the increased ENSO variability registered in Cariaco may have played a key role in the expansion of the Mauritia palm community. It is suggested that in our location, the potential inhabiting human populations were differently influenced by these environmental changes. First, the disappearance of the coastal resources could have favoured land abandonment, whereas the increase in the abundance of the palm might be influential for the arrival of other inland cultures that were previously used to manage Mauritia. This sequence shows the importance of the ecosystem services for the location inhabitants, highlighting the abandonment of the mid-Holocene culture coeval with the disappearance of its ecosystem. These results also provide information about the sensitivity and resilience in facing external stressors of both humans and vegetation, and will be valuable tools for managing the future of this ecosystem.",

      "abstract": "Deforestation and agrosystem establishment can alter soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, leading to greenhouse gases emissions and fertility losses, however SOC response has great variability. In the humid tropics like the Amazonia biome, carbon inputs from agrosystems are rarely quantified and described, despite their major contribution to the SOC dynamics after deforestation. We assessed SOC dynamics with repeated measurements in the layer 0–30cm until five years after deforestation in a diachronic site in French Guiana, cleared with a fire-free method associated to large woody debris inputs. Three agrosystems were studied: one year maize/soybean rotation with disk tillage (DT) and without tillage (NT), and a mowed grassland (G). Aboveground carbon inputs from agrosystems were measured. In addition to SOC stocks assessment, we measured roots carbon stocks, and performed δ13C measurements in grassland soil. We found a transient SOC stock increase until 1.5 years after deforestation because of large woody debris inputs from deforestation method, but these C inputs were rapidly mineralized and poorly contributed to SOC stocks 5 years after deforestation. SOC stocks in grassland did not differ from forest despite large hay exports. Thanks to large root-derived carbon inputs, C4-SOC stock in grassland was 10.4tha−1 5 years after deforestation (18.7% of the SOC stock). In annual crops, 5 years after deforestation, SOC stocks decreased on average by 18.6% compared to forest. SOC stocks did not differ according to soil tillage since aboveground carbon inputs were similar in DT and NT systems. Lower SOC stocks in annual crops compared to grassland is explained by lower carbon restitutions and by higher mineralization rate of organic matter.",

      "abstract": "The Amazonian environment is changing rapidly, due to deforestation, in the short term, and, climatic change is projected to alter its forest cover, in the next few decades. These modifications to the, environment have been altering the dynamics of infectious diseases which have natural foci in the, Amazonian biome, especially in its forest. Current land use practices which are changing the, epidemiological profile of the parasitic diseases in the region are road building; logging; mining; expansion of agriculture and cattle ranching and the building of large dams. Malaria and the cutaneous, leishmaniasis are the diseases best known for their rapid changes in response to environmental, modifications. Others such as soil-transmitted helminthiases, filarial infections and toxoplasmosis, which have part of their developmental cycles in the biophysical environment, are also expected to, change rapidly. An interdisciplinary approach and an integrated, international surveillance are needed, to manage the environmentally-driven changes in the Amazonian parasitic diseases in the near future.",

      "abstract": "In view of the unique biological characteristics of mangroves, it is interesting to assess the extent to which these ecosystems can be used as indicators of coastal change or sea-level rise. From recent studies of mangrove mortality at several locations (including Guiana, Gambia, Côte d'Ivoire, Kenya, India and Bangladesh), it appears that these coastal ecosystems are so specialized that any minor variation in their hydrological or tidal regimes causes noticeable mortality. Each species of mangrove (but particularly those belonging to the genera Rhizophora, Bruguiera, Sonneratia, Heritiera and Nypa) occurs in ecological conditions that approach its limit of tolerance with regard to salinity of the water and soil, as well as the inundation regime. If the duration of daily immersion were to be modified by tectonic, sedimentological or hydrological events, the species either readjusts to the new conditions or succumbs to unsuitable conditions. Consequently, the use of remote sensing data for mangrove ecosystems offers excellent potential as a tool for monitoring coastal change.",

Additional pressures are being put on species that are bought and sold in the international pet trade. Some of this trade is legal and has only limited effects on insect populations.

The kinds of insects that are in greatest jeopardy from the international pet trade include species that are extremely beautiful to the human eye (mostly butterflies), extremely large (walking sticks and beetles), extremely dangerous (tarantula, scorpions, and centipedes), or used as human food (ants, grasshoppers, beetle larvae, true bugs, and others).",

      "abstract": "Background\nThe four common soil-transmitted helminth species—Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and the two hookworm species Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus—are endemic in South America, but their distribution, infection prevalence, and regional burden are poorly understood. We aimed to estimate the risk and number of people infected with A lumbricoides, T trichiura, and hookworm across South America.\nMethods\nWe did a systematic review of reports on the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth infection in South America published up to May 14, 2012. We extracted and georeferenced relevant survey data and did a meta-analysis of the data to assess the geographical distribution of the infection risk with Bayesian geostatistical models. We used advanced Bayesian variable selection to identify environmental determinants that govern the distribution of soil-transmitted helminth infections.\nFindings\nWe screened 4085 scientific papers and identified 174 articles containing relevant survey prevalence data. We georeferenced 6948 survey locations and entered the data into the open-access Global Neglected Tropical Diseases database. Survey data were sparse for the south of the continent and for the western coast, and we identified no relevant information for Uruguay and little data for smaller countries such as Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana, and Ecuador. Population-adjusted prevalence of infection with A lumbricoides was 15·6%, with T trichiura was 12·5%, and with hookworm was 11·9% from 2005 onwards. Risks of contracting soil-transmitted helminth infection have substantially reduced since 2005 (odds ratio 0·47 [95% Bayesian credible interval 0·46–0·47] for A lumbricoides, 0·54 [0·54–0·55] for T trichiura, and 0·58 [0·58–0·59] for hookworm infection).\nInterpretation\nOur findings offer important baseline support for spatial targeting of soil-transmitted helminthiasis control, and suggest that more information about the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth infection is needed, especially in countries in which we estimate prevalence of infection to be high but for which current data are scarce.\nFunding\nUBS Optimus Foundation and Brazilian Swiss Joint Research Programme (BSJRP 011008).",

      "abstract": "Tropical forests are affected by recent climate change, but detailed knowledge how forests in different regions of the tropics respond to changing climate conditions is not sufficiently studied. Our objectives were to evaluate climatic effects on the monthly cambial activity of Pinus latteri and Pinus kesiya and to determine the relationships between climatic variables (precipitation, temperature, and relative humidity) and the tree-ring widths of these two pine species. Cambial dynamics of P. latteri and P. kesiya in subtropical Thailand were studied for two consecutive growing seasons. We observed that monthly rainfall, relative humidity, soil moisture, monthly minimum temperature, and monthly mean temperature were positively related to the number of cambial cell layers and cambial zone width. Moisture in the late dry season and in the beginning of the rainy season was very important in stimulating cambial cell division after a long-term moisture deficit for more than three months. The growth responses to climate in a 128-year-long chronology of P. latteri and an 88-year-long chronology of P. kesiya were similar. Importantly, the amount of rainfall and relative humidity in April and May had positive effects on the tree-ring widths of both pine species. On the other hand, both mean monthly maximum temperature and mean monthly temperature had negative effects on tree-ring widths. P. kesiya is more susceptible to drought, as shown by its correlation with the self-calibrated Palmer drought severity index. The rising temperatures during the recent 30-year observation period clearly show that higher temperatures covered the northern and central regions of Thailand and are likely to reduce the productivity of both pine species.",

      "abstract": "Bats are ecologically important mammals in tropical ecosystems; however, their populations face numerous environmental threats related to climate change, habitat loss, fragmentation, hunting, and emerging diseases. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop and implement large-scale networks to monitor trends in bat populations over extended time periods. Using data from a range of Neotropical and Paleotropical bat assemblages, we assessed the ability for long-term monitoring programs to reliably detect temporal trends in species abundance. We explored the magnitude of within-site temporal variation in abundance and evaluated the statistical power of a suite of different sampling designs for several different bat species and ensembles. Despite pronounced temporal variation in abundance of most tropical bat species, power simulations suggest that long-term monitoring programs (⩾20years) can detect population trends of 5% per year or more with adequate statistical power (⩾0.9). However, shorter monitoring programs (⩽10years) have insufficient power for trend detection. Overall, our analyses demonstrate that a monitoring program extending over 20years with four surveys conducted biennially on five plots per monitoring site would have the potential for detecting a 5% annual change in abundance for a suite of bat species from different ensembles. The likelihood of reaching adequate statistical power was sensitive to initial species abundance and the magnitude of count variation, stressing that only the most abundant species in an assemblage and those with generally low variation in abundance should be considered for detailed population monitoring.",

      "abstract": "We investigate the redistribution of terrigenous materials in the northeastern (NE) South American continental margin during slowdown events of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The compilation of stratigraphic data from 108 marine sediment cores collected across the western tropical Atlantic shows an extreme rise in sedimentation rates off the Parnaíba River mouth (about 2°S) during Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1, 18–15 ka). Sediment core GeoB16206-1, raised offshore the Parnaíba River mouth, documents relatively constant 143Nd/144Nd values (expressed as εNd(0)) throughout the last 30 ka. Whereas the homogeneous εNd(0) data support the input of fluvial sediments by the Parnaíba River from the same source area directly onshore, the increases in Fe/Ca, Al/Si and Rb/Sr during HS1 indicate a marked intensification of fluvial erosion in the Parnaíba River drainage basin. In contrast, the εNd(0) values from sediment core GeoB16224-1 collected off French Guiana (about 7°N) suggest Amazon-sourced materials within the last 30 ka. We attribute the extremely high volume of terrigenous sediments deposited offshore the Parnaíba River mouth during HS1 to (i) an enhanced precipitation in the catchment region and (ii) a reduced North Brazil Current, which are both associated with a weakened AMOC.",

      "abstract": "Stable isotopes in gibbsite and kaolinite were analyzed to reconstruct the Amazonia palaeoclimate during the Cenozoic and to investigate the environmental conditions of the weathering process and the origin of the Oxisol that cover the lateritic/bauxite crust. At least two types of kaolinite were identified in the Oxisol; near the surface, the kaolinite is less fractionated and was developed at a higher temperature (35°C). This is probably due to the effect of vegetation and/or evapotranspiration or is a consequence of surface microenvironmental conditions or allochthonous inputs. The other kaolinite samples ranged in formation temperatures from 21°C to 26°C and developed under conditions similar to the Pleistocene and the modern climate of Amazonia. At least two types of gibbsite were found. One type developed in the modern Amazonia climate, in a way similar to most kaolinite samples, whereas the samples of the other type are more fractionated. This is because they may have been formed in low recycling rainwater and/or under a low amount of precipitation. These two conditions indicate a seasonal climate for bauxite development that can be linked to the low exhumation of the Andes cordillera and its geographical position relative to the Trombetas region during the period ranging from the Late Oligocene to the Early Miocene. At the end of the Cenozoic, the climate was less seasonal and wetter and the temperature was lower In addition, there was the probable inland position of the Trombetas region, which allowed Oxisol development. The gibbsite developed earlier than the kaolinite of the Oxisol, but there is a partial inheritance, or temporal equivalence, among the bauxite horizon and the Oxisol, as well as multiple generations of gibbsite and kaolinite, which is to be expected for materials developing over long periods in hard leaching conditions.",

      "abstract": "We use first field-based observations of precipitation and river isotopic chemistry from a three-year study (2009–2011) in rainforest and nearby savannah in central Guyana at the northern rim of the Amazon rainforest to establish the quality of modelled or remotely-sensed datasets. Our 3 years of data capture a reduced rainfall regime in 2009 and an extended wet season in 2010, in contrast to the widely documented Amazonian floods in 2009 and droughts in 2010. Comparisons of observed precipitation with satellite derived TRMM and ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis precipitation show that both of these data sets capture the general pattern of seasonality, but substantially underestimate rainfall amounts in the primary wet season (by up to 50% and 72% respectively). The TRMM dataset is generally better at characterising the main dry season from September to December but the ERA-Interim model can overestimate precipitation in the dry season by up to 175%. Our new data on isotopic chemistry of river waters show that δ2H/δ18O values in this region are broadly consistent with interpolated global datasets of modelled precipitation isotopic signatures. The dominance of isotopically lighter water derived from the rains of the ITCZ during the wet season provides evidence of the close coupling of water chemistry of headwater rivers on the northern rim of Amazonia to the positioning of the ITCZ over the region. Our results highlight the challenge in understanding and representing local scale hydrological and biogeochemical characteristics using regional scale model data. We argue that combining point and local scale field data with larger scale model data is necessary to progress towards a comprehensive understanding of climate–hydrology interactions in Amazonia.",

      "abstract": "The giant otter, Pteronura brasiliensis, occupies a range including the major drainage basins of South America, yet the degree of structure that exists within and among populations inhabiting these drainages is unknown. We sequenced portions of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome b (612bp) and control region (383bp) genes in order to determine patterns of genetic variation within the species. We found high levels of mtDNA haplotype diversity (h=0.93 overall) and support for subdivision into four distinct groups of populations, representing important centers of genetic diversity and useful units for prioritizing conservation within the giant otter. We tested these results against the predictions of three hypotheses of Amazonian diversification (Pleistocene Refugia, Paleogeography, and Hydrogeology). While the phylogeographic pattern conformed to the predictions of the Refugia Hypothesis, molecular dating using a relaxed clock revealed the phylogroups diverged from one another between 1.69 and 0.84Ma, ruling out the influence of Late Pleistocene glacial refugia. However, the role of Plio-Pleistocene climate change could not be rejected. While the molecular dating also makes the influence of geological arches according to the Paleogeography Hypothesis extremely unlikely, the recent Pliocene formation of the Fitzcarrald Arch and its effect of subsequently altering drainage pattern could not be rejected. The data presented here support the interactions of both climatic and hydrological changes resulting from geological activity in the Plio-Pleistocene, in shaping the phylogeographic structure of the giant otter.",

      "abstract": "We determined individual nest placement patterns for female leatherbacks nesting at Awa:la-Ya:lima:po, French Guiana, by measuring distance from the nest to several landscape features, such as the highest spring tide line (HSTL) and the vegetation line. Distance from the nest to the HSTL differed significantly between females, indicating the existence of individual nesting patterns. There was a significant repeatability of nest site choice relative to the HSTL, indicating that females showed within-individual consistency in their nest placement. Despite individual preferences, there was much within-individual variation and a lack of predictability in the nesting patterns; that is, the locations of subsequent nests could not be predicted based on knowledge of previous nest choices, indicating a certain degree of scatter. The significant repeatability suggests that nest choice behaviour in female leatherbacks is heritable and may show the potential for further evolution. We tested sea-finding ability of hatchlings, a potential consequence of nest site choice, in Matapica, Suriname, by using orientation arenas to quantify the strength and direction of travel after emergence. The orientation tests showed that hatchlings were unable to move seaward in vegetated arenas, providing evidence that vegetation acts as a strong selective pressure driving nest placement seaward. It appears that leatherbacks have adopted a regional rather than a local optimum for nest placement patterns, possibly resulting from their weak beach fidelity and the frequent erosion and destruction of their nesting beaches. We discuss the evolutionary and conservation implications for this species in the context of current environmental changes.",

      "abstract": "Bridges are the most vulnerable assets of our transport networks. They are disproportionately exposed to and hit by multiple natural hazards, with flooding being the leading cause of bridge failures in the world. Their performance is constantly challenged by the combined effects of natural hazard stressors, e.g. flash floods, exacerbated by climate change, ageing, increasing traffic volumes and loads. Bridges are vulnerable to scour and other flood-related impacts, such as hydraulic forces and debris accumulation. In order to assess and quantify the resilience of flood-critical bridges and subsequently deploy bridge resilience models aiming at building resilience into transport networks, it is essential to use reliable fragility, capacity restoration and traffic reinstatement metrics and models. It is surprising that, despite the importance of bridges and their high vulnerability to hydraulic actions, there are no available recovery models. The latter can help quantify the pace of post-flood capacity and functionality gain for facilitating well-informed decision making for reliable prioritisation and efficient allocation of resources in transport networks. The main barrier is the nature and complexity of recovery actions, which encompass engineering, operational, owner resources and organisational challenges, among others. This paper, for the first time in the international literature, aims at filling this gap by generating a set of reliable recovery models that include both bridge reinstatement (traffic capacity) and restoration (structural capacity) models based on a detailed questionnaire that elicits knowledge from experts. Recovery models are then presented and validated for spread and deep foundations for a typical reinforced concrete bridge, including restoration task prioritisation and scheduling, inter-task dependencies, idle times, durations and cost ratios for different damage levels, as well as the evolution of traffic capacity after floods.",

The region's natural resources need to be well managed to strengthen the institutional capacity of the countries in the region to promote social, economic, environmental, and health equity and sustainability. Foodborne diseases are an important cause of morbidity and mortality. The types of diseases and their impacts are diverse in different communities and on public health. The estimated global burden of foodborne disease is considerable for each region, but it is impossible to be fully aware of all unsafe foods that cause illness. A portion of foodborne disease is recognized and reported to public health authorities and recorded in official disease statistics. This article presents and discusses some results of studies and the main points on foodborne diseases in the Latin America and Caribbean region.",

      "abstract": "Research has repeatedly shown that ongoing habitat loss and the increasing frequency of extreme climatic events have altered fundamental biological processes, threatening biodiversity and ecosystem functioning worldwide. However, the multitude of interacting factors underlying the impacts of these threats remain poorly understood in tropical forests. This is unfortunate because the majority of terrestrial biodiversity resides in these habitats. The responses of organisms to environmental changes are often studied indirectly, for example, using discrete snapshots at different time periods at the same location. This is due to the challenges of compiling long-term data, especially for invertebrates. Evaluating how functionally important species assemblages will respond to anthropogenic threats requires continuous long-term monitoring. This is vital for arthropods because they are responsible for crucial ecosystem services and human food security. Here, we review existing arthropod monitoring schemes and consider some innovative avenues for future research that promise to improve monitoring of this important group in tropical systems.",

      "abstract": "Background\nTungiasis is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) found in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. Despite the high frequency in marginalized populations, little information is available on the geography and estimates of the population at risk in endemic regions. Here we used a geostatistical model to map the potential geographic distribution of areas suitable for tungiasis transmission in Latin America and estimated the at-risk population.\nMethods\nWe developed an ecological niche model (ENM) using tungiasis occurrence records and remotely sensed environmental and socioeconomic data. The potential geographic distribution was then compared to the current population distribution of the region to derive the total population living in urban and rural areas.\nFindings\nWe identified a total of 138 records of occurrences of tungiasis in Latin America, ranging from Mexico to Argentina; 27 reports were not included in the modeling, due to missing detailed geographic information. The occurrences with detailed geographic information (n = 112) included 17 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. The locations were in environments that primarily consisted of forests (29%), croplands (16•5%), and shrublands (10•9%). We predicted environmentally suitable areas for tungiasis transmission in 45 countries. The estimated human population living in these areas is 450,546,547 with urban centers accounting for 347,007,103 and rural areas 103,539,444. Countries with significant ecological suitability and documented occurrences include Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, French Guyana, Guatemala, Haiti, Paraguay, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela.\nInterpretation\nThis is the first study mapping the potential distribution of tungiasis in Latin America, evidencing the need for population-based studies and elaboration of integrated control measures.\nFunding\nThis project was supported in part by an appointment to the Research Participation Program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention administered by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education through an interagency agreement between the U.S. Department of Energy and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

      "abstract": "Globally, sea levels are rising due to climate change which would influence the salinity levels in mangroves. In the framework of this study, we focused on the influence of salinity and differences of forest structure on the fine root biomass (FRB) and carbon stocks in the Sundarbans mangrove forest, Bangladesh. Also, the relationships FRB to different stand structural parameters were investigated using the data obtained from 50 sample plots (100 sq. m each) in different salinity zones in Sundarbans. Four random soil samples (30 cm in length) were taken within study plots, which were further divided into 10 cm, 20 cm, and 30 cm to identify the most active soil layer for FRB stocks. Results suggest differences in forest structural parameters and diversity indices with salinity changes in different saline zones. The low and medium saline zone is dominated by Heriteira fomes, while Excoecaria agallocha dominates the high saline zone. The carbon stocks (Mg C ha−1) in Sundarbans show a significant decrease with increasing salinity in different saline zones, e.g. oligohaline (252 ± 60.2), mesohaline (199 ± 37.7), and polyhaline (171 ± 20.0) zone. FRB carbon (Mg C ha−1) allocation in different saline zones also followed a decreasing order, such as oligohaline (12.8), mesohaline (7.9), and polyhaline (7.3). Fine root biomass showed a decreasing trend with increasing soil depth, where the differences, however, were not significant (p > 0.05) among the soil layers. Our results provide evidence on FRB variations in Sundarbans, which has implications on the mangrove species conservation and management. The mature stands at different saline zones of Sundarbans mangrove forest, Bangladesh has a high fine root biomass, which is valuable for mangrove restoration and the studied species plantation in the shore line or coastal area which can help to decrease the erosion effects of tidal inundation.",

      "abstract": "The Caribbean nation of Suriname has historically depended on a mix of hydropower and oil-based fossil fuels for meeting electricity needs. Continued reliance on fossil fuels poses challenges both for climate change mitigation and for energy security. This paper explores the potential for increasing the share of renewables in Suriname's electricity mix, with a special focus on the complementary role of existing hydropower and future wind power infrastructure. We show that these resources have great synergetic potential for displacing fossil fuel-based power generation. Flexible operation of the Afobaka hydropower plant, newly in full possession of Suriname, allows significant wind power integration without violating grid stability and associated power quality requirements. Considering the trade-off between displacing expensive fossil fuels and limiting wind power curtailment on Suriname's island-like grid, our results suggest that integrating wind power in the Surinamese electricity mix is economically advantageous up to a share of 20–30%, independently of near-term demand growth. These results have wider relevance for climate policy in various Caribbean countries and other island states with existing hydropower infrastructure and substantial wind/solar power potential, for which this study fills an important literature gap.",

      "abstract": "The Demerara plateau, located offshore French Guiana and Suriname, is part of a passive transform continental margin particularly prone to develop slope instabilities, probably in relation to the presence of a free distal border along its steep continental slope. Slope failure occurred at different periods (Cretaceous to Neogene) and shows an overall retrogressive evolution through time. Upslope these failure headscarp, an enigmatic regional Mio-Pliocene unconformity has been discovered through the interpretation of new academic and industrial datasets. The aim of this work is to describe and understand the origin of this surface. Our analysis shows that this unconformity is made of a series of valleys that cross-cut sedimentary strata. Each one of these valleys has a short lateral extent and is closed along two perpendicular directions, which suggests that it could correspond to a highly meandering system, or to some sub-circular depressions. The infill of these features is equivalent to the regional stratigraphic strata found outside the structures, but in a subdued position. This seems to imply that the structures have originated by a local loss of sediments at their base or by sliding processes. Furthermore, these depressions intersect each other through time, while migrating progressively downslope. We discuss a series of hypotheses that try to explain the onset and evolution of these depressions forming the Mio-Pliocene unconformity (Canyons? Slope failures? Contourite moats? Hydrate pockmarks?). Having established that these structures are depressions formed by collapse, and have many similarities with structures recently described in the literature as pockmarks associated with gas hydrate dissolution, we favor this hypothesis. We propose that these hydrate pockmarks form with a mass failure that was triggered by fluid-overpressure development at the base of the hydrate stability zone.",

      "abstract": "Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) are exceptionally voluminous magmatic events frequently related to continental break-up, global climate changes and mass extinctions. One interesting aspect of many LIPs is their spatial proximity to cratons, begging the question of a potential control of thick lithosphere on their emplacement. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the emplacement of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) and the thick lithospheric mantle of the Precambrian cratons that formed the central portion of Pangea and are currently located on the continents surrounding the Central Atlantic Ocean. CAMP outcrops are frequently located over the margins of the thick cratonic keels, as imaged by recent tomographic studies, suggesting a role of lithosphere architecture in controlling magma genesis and emplacement. Here we focus on CAMP dykes and sills from the Hank, Hodh, and Kaarta basins in North-Western Africa (NW-Africa, Mali and Mauritania) emplaced at the edge of the Reguibat and Leo-Man Shields. The investigated intrusive rocks show compositions similar to most CAMP magmas, in particular those of the Tiourjdal geochemical group, limited to NW-Africa, and of the Prevalent group, occurring all over the CAMP. Geochemical modelling of CAMP basalts requires a Depleted MORB Mantle (DMM) source enriched by recycled continental crust (1-4%) and melting beneath a lithosphere of ca. 80 km in thickness. On the contrary, melting under a significantly thicker lithosphere (>110 km) does not produce magmas with compositions similar to those of CAMP basalts. This suggests that CAMP magmatism was likely favoured by decompression-induced partial melting of the upwelling asthenospheric mantle along the steep lithospheric boundaries of stable cratons. The architecture of the pre-existing lithosphere (i.e., the presence of stable thick cratonic keels juxtaposed to relatively thinner lithosphere) appears to have been a critical factor for localizing mantle upwelling and partial melting during extensive magmatic events such as in the CAMP.",

      "abstract": "Mangrove forests rank as one of the world's most productive biomes and their soils are highly efficient in accumulating organic carbon (OC). Most research on OC in mangrove forests has focused on moist tropical and sub-tropical regions. Here we examine an arid mangrove forest (composed of the species Avicennia marina) from the Jask area in southern Iran. The organic carbon content, TOC:TN ratios and δ13C signatures indicate that marine algae and microalgae are a greater source of organic material than the terrestrial inputs at three out of the four study sites in this work. Furthermore, sea-level rise as well as geomorphic and topographic differences are contributing to the mangrove landward migration and expansion of 112 ha (or 33%) of these arid forests between 1956 and 2012. This is substantial as up to 0.60 g OC cm−2 were found in the upper 42 cm of the soils. However, these values should be taken with caution as the large inorganic carbon deposition in the soils here and in other regions may offset the CO2 sequestration of the global arid mangroves in terms of climate mitigation.",

Atmospheric moisture was increased indirectly by increasing the sea surface temperature (SST) in the simulation initial conditions, and by letting the regional atmospheric model adjust the atmospheric fields to the SST perturbation. The SST was increased in two ways: 1) using spatially constant increments and 2) using a climate change perturbation field obtained from a climate projection. For each SST scenario, the PD over the target area was maximized by using a physically based storm transposition method. Although the mean PD, that was obtained by averaging over all shifting increments, increased with SST, the maximum PD was obtained for the case of no SST increase. It was found that, in the case of no SST increase, the worst-case tropical cyclone track was significantly different than in the SST increase scenarios. In particular, in this case, the storm spent a longer time in the simulation inner domain, thus spawning a larger PD over the target area.",

      "abstract": "We review literature relevant to assessing the future of tropical forests and supplement the review with new data from the lowlands of Venezuela. Compared to today, future tropical forests will have a higher level of novelty, defined as the degree of dissimilarity of a system relative to a historical baseline. Processes of succession and evolution generate novelty in forests and have done so for millennia. Under increasing human activity and climate change, the rate of generation of novelty has increased and the resulting forests are termed novel forests to distinguish them from historical forests. Historical forests are less exposed to anthropogenic disturbances and operate at slower levels of novelty generation. Acclimation, adaptation, changes in species composition and dominance, and changes in the proportions of species in communities are the responses of the biota to climate change and anthropogenic disturbances. Therefore, novelty contributes to the persistence of tropical forests in spite of increasing levels of human activity. Novel forests are similar to historical forests in terms of structure but they are younger, they have a faster turnover of mass and chemical elements, and different species composition. Historical species assemblages cannot cope with the altered environments that result from chronic anthropogenic disturbances. The dominant species in novel forests tend to be, and function as, pioneer species. High levels of species dominance in novel forests influence the proportions of chemical elements, which when coupled to species traits and attributes, help explain how novel forests cope with the conditions that result from anthropogenic activities. Novelty is more common in the tropics than in other latitudinal regions, and within the tropics, it is more common in islands where human activity is more intense than in continents. Novel tropical forests in islands have greater representation and dominance of introduced species than novel forests in continents, where native species with wide geographic distributions dominate. Regardless of geography, novel tropical forests share similar attributes and functioning. The adaptability of novel forests to extreme conditions created by human activity signals a future for tropical forests that is different from predictions of constant degradation, homogenization, and loss of biodiversity. Instead, a process of recombination of species (all taxa) into new species assemblages maintains structure, function, physiognomy, species richness, and ecological services. This remixing initially involves loss of large organisms, certain groups of species, and loss of old-growth attributes of forests. Some of these losses can be reversed through succession, assuming there is sufficient time to restore depleted stores such as soil organic matter. Continued environmental change will stimulate continued remixing of species, loss of vulnerable species, gains of less vulnerable ones, and more dissimilarity with historical forests. Novel forests are an answer to the changes induced by climate change and other anthropogenic disturbances, and as such require conservation measures, because as they mature, novel forests usually diversify and help restore lost biodiversity. We also review strategies to conserve biodiversity and optimize ecological services using novel forest succession.",

      "abstract": "Introduction\nNeglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in developing countries like the Caribbean, negatively affect multiple income-generating sectors, including the tourism industry upon which island states are highly dependent. Insect-transmitted NTDs include, but are not limited to, malaria, dengue and lymphatic filariasis. Control measures for these disease, are often ignored because of the associated cost. Many of the developing country members are thus retained in a financially crippling cycle, balancing the cost of prophylactic measures with that of controlling an outbreak. The purpose of the paper is to bring awareness to NTDs transmitted by insects of importance to humans, and to assess factors affecting such control, in the English-speaking Caribbean.\nMethod\nComprehensive literature review on reports pertaining to NTDs transmitted by insects in the Caribbean and Latin America was conducted. Data search was carried out on PubMed, and WHO and PAHO websites.\nResults and conclusion\nPotential risk factors for NTDs transmitted by arthropods in the English-speaking Caribbean are summarised. The mosquito appears to be the main insect-vector of human importance within the region of concern. Arthropod-vectors of diseases of veterinary importance are also relevant because they affect the livelihood of farmers, in highly agriculture based economies. Other NTDs may also be in circulation gauged by the presence of antibodies in Caribbean individuals. However, routine diagnostic tests for specific diseases are expensive and tests may not be conducted when diseases are not prevalent in the population. It appears that only a few English-speaking Caribbean countries have examined secondary reservoirs of pathogens or assessed the effectivity of their insect control methods. As such, disease risk assessment appears incomplete. Although continuous control is financially demanding, an integrated and multisectoral approach might help to deflect the cost. Such interventions are now being promoted by health agencies within the region and various countries are creating and exploring the use of novel tools to be incorporated in their insect-vector control programmes.",

      "abstract": "The green credentials of hydroelectricity in terms of greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions have been tarnished with the finding of the researches on GHG emissions from hydroelectric reservoirs in the last two decades. Substantial amounts of GHGs release from the tropical reservoirs, especially methane (CH4) from Brazil’s Amazonian areas. CH4 contributes strongly to climate change because it has a global warming potential (GWP) 24times higher than carbon dioxide (CO2) on a per molecule basis over a 100-year time horizon. GHGs may emit from reservoirs through four different pathways to the atmosphere: (1) diffusive flux at the reservoir surface, (2) gas bubble flux in the shallow zones of a reservoir, (3) water degassing flux at the outlet of the powerhouse downstream of turbines and spillways, and (4) flux across the air–water interface in the rivers downstream of the dams. This paper reviewed the productions and emissions of CH4, CO2, and N2O in reservoirs, and the environmental variables influencing CH4 and CO2 emissions were also summarized. Moreover, the paper combined with the progress of GHG emissions from Three Gorges Reservoir and proposed three crucial problems to be resolved on GHG emissions from reservoirs at present, which would be benefit to estimate the total GHG emissions from Three Gorges Reservoir accurately.",

      "abstract": "The combined effects of isolation within an unfavourable matrix and vegetation development were studied in patches of scrub vegetation on a tropical inselberg (Nouragues, French Guiana). Three thickets ∼10m2 area were sampled, located at ∼30m distance from each other, in which the same vegetation types were present at less than 3m distance: canopies of Clusia minor (Clusiaceae) and Myrcia saxatilis (Myrtaceae), two stages of thicket development, and zones of destruction by fire. The shallow organic soil was sampled over ∼2dm2 and down to 10cm. The matrix was comprised of granite without any soil development. Arthropods were classified into morphospecies and their food diets were characterized by optical methods. The effect of isolation (between-thicket variation) on morphospecies composition was negligible, while that of vegetation type and fire (within-thicket variation) was prominent, as ascertained by principal component analysis and tested by partial redundance analysis. The importance of keystone structures (stages of vegetation development) was stressed, and interpreted to the light of taxonomic and foodweb knowledge.",

      "abstract": "Background\nCutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) has traditionally been underrecognized and underreported. Improved awareness is warranted as the number of cases has increased as a result of increased travel to endemic countries, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and the larger number of military and contract workers deployed overseas.\nObjective\nWe sought to present a systematic review of evidence from a gamut of research trials on the treatment efficacy of different regimens and aggregate this knowledge for use as a guide for clinical practice decisions.\nMethods\nWe performed a comprehensive search of print and electronic sources to identify the accumulated research information on New World CL.\nResults\nTopical treatment of New World CL lesions is generally not recommended. Findings support the systemic administration of pentavalent antimonials as first-line treatment. Exception to this is infection with L guyanensis in French Guiana where systemic pentamidine is suggested as first-line treatment.\nLimitations\nThe reliability of the findings of this review of research evidence is dependent on the individual quality and potential bias in its component principal trials. There was a conscious attempt to only include evidence derived from randomized controlled studies, with adequate randomization, adequate patient numbers, and complete follow-up information. However, because of the relatively small number of such studies on New World CL, evidence from nonrandomized studies and case series studies was also considered.\nConclusions\nThe pentavalent antimony compounds remain the first-line treatment choice for the treatment of New World CL. Concerns with cost, availability, poor compliance, and systemic toxicity, however, may compel clinicians to opt for alternative treatment modalities. Some advances in the development of an antileishmanial vaccine have been made but none is yet available for clinic use. The increase, over recent years, in the incidence of CL warrants an enhanced effort to increase awareness of the disease, assure timely diagnosis, and implement effective management and treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "The effects of climate change on the lowland vegetation of Amazonia during the last glacial cycle are partially known for the middle and late Pleniglacial intervals (late MIS 3, 59–24 ka and MIS 2, 24–11 ka), but are still unclear for older stages of the last glacial and during the last interglacial. It is known that a more seasonal dry-wet climate caused marginal forest retraction and together with cooling rearranged forest composition to some extent. This is observed in pollen records across Amazonia depicting presence of taxa at glacial times in localities where they do not live presently. The understanding of taxa migration is hindered by the lack of continuous interglacial-glacial lowland records. We present new data from a known locality in NW Amazonia (Six Lakes Hill), showing a vegetation record that probably started during MIS 5 (130–71 ka) and lasted until the onset of the Holocene. The vegetation record unravels a novel pattern in tree taxa migration: (1) from the beginning of this cycle Podocarpus and Myrsine are recorded and (2) only later do Hedyosmum and Alnus appear. The latter group is largely restricted to montane biomes or more distant locations outside Amazonia, whereas the first is found in lowlands close to the study site on sandy soils. These findings imply that Podocarpus and Myrsine responded to environmental changes equally and this reflects their concomitant niche use in NW Amazonia. Temperature drop is not discarded as a trigger of internal forest composition change, but its effects are clearer later in the Pleniglacial rather than the Early Glacial. Therefore early climatic/environmental changes had a first order effect on vegetation that invoke alternative explanations. We claim last glacial climate-induced modifications on forest composition favoured the expansion of geomorphologic-soil related processes that initiated forest rearrangement.",

      "abstract": "Parties to the Paris Agreement have a binding obligation to collectively limit global temperature rises to an agreed upon target. Commitments include providing national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory reports to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (‘UNFCCC’) secretariat, reporting their contributions towards the collective target. GHG emissions from upstream oil and gas (O&G) facilities, including those in offshore areas under coastal State jurisdiction (where current activity is occurring in over 50 countries), are to be included within the scope of these reports. Parties to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (‘UNCLOS’) are obligated to adopt and enforce laws and regulations to prevent, reduce, and control pollution arising from seabed exploration and exploitation activities under their jurisdiction. These are to be no less effective than international rules and standards as established through competent international organisations. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), via the Regional Seas Programmes (RSP), are two such organisations that develop international rules and standards covering certain aspects of offshore O&G activities. IMO treaties, rules, and standards cover GHG emissions arising from vessel-related offshore O&G activities, but emissions from O&G industry-specific activities, such as the venting and flaring of reservoir hydrocarbons, are excluded. The only other source of international law, implementing UNCLOS′ requirement, providing international rules and standards for coastal States to benchmark their laws against for the prevention of marine pollution in the form of GHG emissions from offshore O&G activities are the regional instruments of the RSP. However, as this article will show, current RSP coverage is minimal and insufficient, particularly in light of Parties' Paris Agreement and UNCLOS obligations. Examples are provided showing inconsistencies in the reporting of offshore O&G GHG emissions across national inventory reports, as well as examples of applicable requirements prescribed under various RSP instruments, or lack thereof, highlighting the deficiency of a relevant international pollution prevention rule and/or standard across all marine regions.",

      "abstract": "Aridity has increased in recent decades in the Mediterranean Basin and is projected to continue to increase in the coming decades. We studied the consequences of drought on the concentrations, stoichiometries and stocks of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in leaves, foliar litter of a three dominant woody species and soil of a Mediterranean montane holm oak forest where soil-water content was experimentally reduced (15 % lower than the control plots) for 15 years. Nitrogen stocks were lower in the drought plots than in the control plots (8.81 ± 1.01 kg ha−1 in the forest canopy and 856 ± 120 kg ha−1 in the 0−15 cm soil layer), thus representing 7 and 18 % lower N stocks in the canopy and soil respectively. δ15N was consistently higher under drought conditions in all samples, indicating a general loss of N. Foliar C and K stocks were also lower but to a lesser extent than N. Decreases in biomass and C and N stocks due to drought were smallest for the most dominant tall shrub, Phillyrea latifolia, so our results suggest a lower capacity of this forest to store C and nutrients but also substantial resulting changes in forest structure with increasing drought.",

      "abstract": "Between 2012 and 2015, a severe drought and the consequent decrease in water supply in the southeastern region of Brazil reached concerning levels, leading to a water crisis. This situation caused aerial exposure of some reservoirs drawdown zone. This study aims to measure methane fluxes emitted by this drawdown zone along the Funil hydropower reservoir, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It was observed that there was a temporal variation of the methane flux in the sediments exposed in the three scenarios studied: drought, flooding and full (0.43, −0.31 and −0.01 mg CH4 m-2 h-1, respectively). The CH4 flux by area in the scenario with the highest exposed sediment area was 0.195 ton CH4 d-1. Considering the values recorded, the contribution of these emissions must become considered in the overall balance of methane in the atmosphere as a new pathway by reservoirs, mainly with the expected forecasts and possible cycles of droughts that may occur frequently. However, the temporal variability of these fluxes indicated the need for future monitoring initiatives that seek to understand how climate change affects the biochemical processes within the exposed sediments of drawdown zones.",

      "abstract": "Although some associations between the leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea and the Gulf Stream current have been previously suggested, no study has to date demonstrated strong affinities between leatherback movements and this particular frontal system using thorough oceanographic data in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions. The importance of the Gulf Stream frontal system in the selection of high residence time (HRT) areas by the North Atlantic leatherback turtle is assessed here for the first time using state-of-the-art ocean reanalysis products. Ten adult females from the Eastern French Guianese rookery were satellite tracked during post-nesting migration to relate (1) their horizontal movements to physical gradients (Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Sea Surface Height (SSH) and filaments) and biological variables (micronekton and chlorophyll a), and (2) their diving behaviour to vertical structures within the water column (mixed layer, thermocline, halocline and nutricline). All the turtles migrated northward towards the Gulf Stream north wall. Although their HRT areas were geographically remote (spread between 80–30°W and 28–45 °N), all the turtles targeted similar habitats in terms of physical structures, i.e. strong gradients of SST, SSH and a deep mixed layer. This close association with the Gulf Stream frontal system highlights the first substantial synchronization ever observed in this species, as the HRTs were observed in close match with the autumn phytoplankton bloom. Turtles remained within the enriched mixed layer at depths of 38.5±7.9m when diving in HRT areas, likely to have an easier access to their prey and maximize therefore the energy gain. These depths were shallow in comparison to those attained within the thermocline (82.4±5.6m) while crossing the nutrient-poor subtropical gyre, probably to reach cooler temperatures and save energy during the transit. In a context of climate change, anticipating the evolution of such frontal structure under the influence of global warming is crucial to ensure the conservation of this vulnerable species.",

      "abstract": "Changes in above-ground biomass (AGB) of 17 1ha logged plots of terra firme rain forest in the eastern Amazon (Brazil, Paragominas) were monitored for four years (2004–2008) after reduced-impact logging. Over the same time period, we also monitored two 0.5ha plots in adjacent unlogged forest. While AGB in the control plots changed little over the observation period (increased on average 1.4Mgha−1), logging resulted in immediate reductions in ABG that averaged 94.5Mgha−1 (±42.0), which represented 23% of the 410Mgha−1 (±64.9) present just prior to harvesting. Felled trees (dbh>55cm) accounted for 73% (±15) of these immediate losses but only 18.9Mgha−1 (±8.1) of biomass was removed in the extracted logs. During the first year after logging, the annual AGB balance (annual AGB gain by recruitment and growth−annual AGB loss by mortality) remained negative (−31.1Mgha−1year−1; ±16.7), mainly due to continued high mortality rates of damaged trees. During the following three years (2005–2008), average net AGB accumulation in the logged plots was 2.6Mgha−1year−1 (±4.6). Post-logging biomass recovery was mostly through growth (4.3±1.5Mgha−1year−1 for 2004–2005 and 6.8±0.9Mgha−1year−1 for 2005–2008), particularly of large trees. In contrast, tree recruitment contributed little to the observed increases in AGB (1.1±0.6Mgha−1year−1 for 2004–2005 and 3.1±1.3Mgha−1year−1 for 2005–2008). Plots with the lowest residual basal area after logging generally continued to lose more large trees (dbh ≥70cm), and consequently showed the greatest AGB losses and the slowest overall AGB gains. If 100% AGB recovery is desired and the 30-year minimum cutting cycle defined by Brazilian law is adhered to, current logging intensities (6treesha−1) need to be reduced by 40–50%. Such a reduction in logging intensity will reduce financial incomes to loggers, but might be compensated for by the payment of environmental services through the proposed REDD (reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) mechanism of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.",

      "abstract": "Vertebrate population densities were quantified in lowland central Guyana using line-transect censuses at three forest sites subjected to reduced-impact logging (RIL), and three adjacent unlogged sites. We censused a range of forest vertebrate species including large canopy-dwelling and terrestrial birds, three primates, one rodent and one tortoise. Two 4km transects at each site were repeatedly surveyed during the wet season of 2008 to derive population density estimates on the basis of a cumulative survey effort of 416km. RIL had ended within 16 months, and sites had been subjected to a mean extraction rate of 3.9m3ha−1, equivalent to only 1.1treesha−1. Three of the 15 vertebrate species examined here exhibited significantly different abundances at forest RIL sites, two of which were negative. Large frugivores such as primates were less abundant in sites subject to RIL, whereas smaller frugivores, granivores, folivores and insectivores were more common in logged sites. We are unable to reliably distinguish between responses of different taxonomic groups, since robust abundance metrics could only be estimated for four mammal species. Despite this, species traits including dietary guild, body mass, home range size and vertical stratification of forest use are used to explain varying responses. Our findings suggest that responsible reduced-impact logging practices in neotropical forests can be considered as a relatively benign form of forest management that can coexist with the requirements of both local economies and biodiversity conservation. However, our study sites experienced comparably low extraction rates, and detrimental effects such as hunting were low. Our results therefore provide an opportunity to scrutinise the effects of best practice logging systems, though do not necessarily represent typical circumstances across tropical forests.",

      "abstract": "Some 90% of the Guyanese population are at risk from contemporary flood hazard and the potential impacts of climate change and sea-level rise. Such risks are not the product of physical systems alone, and by using a political ecology frame the geography of flood hazard in urban environments can be seen to coevolve with political, social and economic systems. These systems are explored by a historical review which traces the roots of present vulnerability to the colonial experience, and an analysis of contemporary vulnerabilities which draws from a peri-urban and an urban case study. The case studies show that the current fashion in international donor agencies to fund ‘community sponsored development’ has missed an opportunity to enhance security through grassroots empowerment, and rather that those community organisations associated with this system have been co-opted by political elites reproducing embedded distributions of power and vulnerability.",

      "abstract": "For more than a decade, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), national governments, several United Nations agencies and regional organisations have been supporting the development, and now also the implementation of the Strategic Action Programme (SAP) for the Sustainable Management of the Shared Living Marine Resources of the Caribbean and North Brazil Shelf Large Marine Ecosystems (resp. CLME and NBSLME, jointly referred to as the CLME+ region). These Large Marine Ecosystems or LMEs provide critical ecosystem services supporting human well-being in this region, particularly for the fisheries and tourism sectors. Unsustainable fisheries, habitat degradation and pollution are three key threats to CLME+ marine ecosystems, and their effects are being exacerbated by climate change. Root causes of these threats include: weak governance; limited human and financial resources; inadequate knowledge; inadequate public awareness and participation; inadequate consideration of the value of ecosystem goods and services; population and cultural pressures; and trade and external dependency. The CLME+ SAP addresses these weaknesses through six distinct strategies aimed at strengthening regional cooperation, institutional reform, and capacity building at the regional, national and local levels over the short (0–5 years) and medium (6–10 years) term. The SAP has been endorsed at the political level by 24 countries and it will be implemented through a partnership approach: “the Global Alliance for the coordinated implementation of the CLME+ SAP” (“CLME+ SAP Alliance”).",

      "abstract": "On November 5th, 2015, the Fundão dam collapsed in Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil, releasing millions of cubic meters of mud containing mining residue into the Doce River. Two weeks later, the mud arrived to the marine environment, triggering changes in franciscana dolphin habitat, Pontoporia blainvillei, from Franciscana Management Area Ia. This is an isolated population of the most endangered cetacean species in the South Atlantic Ocean. Organohalogen compounds (OHCs) may pose a threat to this endangered population because of their endocrine disrupting properties. Hence, this study sought to determine if there were differences in the bioaccumulation profile of OHC (PCBs, DDTs, Mirex, HCB, HCHs, PBDEs, PBEB, HBBZ and MeO-BDEs) in franciscana dolphins before and after dam collapse and to build a temporal trend. Blubber of 33 stranded individuals was collected in Espírito Santo state for organohalogen assessment between 2003 and 2019. Differences were found between franciscana dolphins collected prior to and after the disaster. Additionally, significant temporal trends for organochlorine pesticides and natural and anthropogenic organobromine were detected. The increase in pesticide concentrations after 2015 is suggestive of their reavailability in the environment. The decline in organobromine over time could be due to their debromination in the marine environment and alterations in the composition of their natural producers. PCBs remained stable during the period of the study. Our findings show an increase in endocrine disruptor concentrations, which is of great concern for this endangered population.",

      "abstract": "The future of tropical biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes will be conservation and restoration of processes of seed dispersal by birds and mammals. Here the Diversity Storage Hypothesis posits that immense biological diversity resides within skewed species-abundance distributions of tropical trees, and further predicts that many species will adjust to increases of 1.5–3.0 °C anticipated from climate change by 2100. Common and widespread tropical trees (>100,000,000 individuals) may shift ranges but are unlikely to face extinction. Many rare species (e.g. <1000 individuals) have a more precarious future. The latter may be declining species bound for extinction, incipient species adjusting to environmental changes, or relics of past warmer and more seasonal climates that will be resurrected if processes of seed dispersal allow them to persist and spread. In fragmented agricultural landscapes, preserved or planted corridors, buffers and stepping-stone habitat patches around and between forest remnants are more vital than efforts to preserve or create contemporary forest compositions, dominance relations, and species-abundance distributions. An implication of Diversity Storage is that it is more important to facilitate migration into and out of changing landscapes to allow inherent diversity to adjust and coexist with agricultural economies than to resist change.",

      "abstract": "Amazonian rivers function as important barriers to dispersal of Amazonian birds. Studying population genetics of lineages separated by rivers may help us to uncover the dynamics of biological diversification in the Amazon. We reconstructed the phylogeography of the Wedge-billed Woodcreeper, Glyphorynchus spirurus (Furnariidae) in the Amazon basin. Sampling included 134 individuals from 63 sites distributed in eight Amazonian areas of endemism separated by major Amazonian rivers. Nucleotide sequences were generated for five genes: two mtDNA genes (1047bp for cyt b and 1002bp for ND2) and three nuclear genes (647bp from the sex-linked gene ACO, 319bp from the intron of G3PDH, and 619bp from intron 2 of MYO). In addition, 37 individuals were randomly selected from the Rondônia and Inambari areas of endemism for genomic fingerprinting, using five ISSR primers. Our results reveal allopatric and well-supported lineages within G. spirurus with high levels of genetic differentiation (p-distances 0.9–6.3%) across opposite banks of major Amazonian rivers. The multilocus phylogenetic reconstructions obtained reveal several incongruences with current subspecies taxonomy. Within currently recognized subspecies, we found high levels of both paraphyly and genetic differentiation, indicating deep divergences and strong isolation consistent with species-level differences. ISSR fingerprinting supports the existence of genetically differentiated populations on opposite sides of the Madeira River. Molecular dating suggests an initial vicariation event isolating populations from the Guiana center of endemism during the Late Miocene/Early Pliocene, while more recent events subdivided Brazilian Shield populations during the Lower Pleistocene.",

      "abstract": "Tropical forests are the most diverse and productive ecosystems on Earth. While better understanding of these forests is critical for our collective future, until quite recently efforts to measure and monitor them have been largely disconnected. Networking is essential to discover the answers to questions that transcend borders and the horizons of funding agencies. Here we show how a global community is responding to the challenges of tropical ecosystem research with diverse teams measuring forests tree-by-tree in thousands of long-term plots. We review the major scientific discoveries of this work and show how this process is changing tropical forest science. Our core approach involves linking long-term grassroots initiatives with standardized protocols and data management to generate robust scaled-up results. By connecting tropical researchers and elevating their status, our Social Research Network model recognises the key role of the data originator in scientific discovery. Conceived in 1999 with RAINFOR (South America), our permanent plot networks have been adapted to Africa (AfriTRON) and Southeast Asia (T-FORCES) and widely emulated worldwide. Now these multiple initiatives are integrated via ForestPlots.net cyber-infrastructure, linking colleagues from 54 countries across 24 plot networks. Collectively these are transforming understanding of tropical forests and their biospheric role. Together we have discovered how, where and why forest carbon and biodiversity are responding to climate change, and how they feedback on it. This long-term pan-tropical collaboration has revealed a large long-term carbon sink and its trends, as well as making clear which drivers are most important, which forest processes are affected, where they are changing, what the lags are, and the likely future responses of tropical forests as the climate continues to change. By leveraging a remarkably old technology, plot networks are sparking a very modern revolution in tropical forest science. In the future, humanity can benefit greatly by nurturing the grassroots communities now collectively capable of generating unique, long-term understanding of Earth's most precious forests.\nResumen\nLos bosques tropicales son los ecosistemas más diversos y productivos del mundo y entender su funcionamiento es crítico para nuestro futuro colectivo. Sin embargo, hasta hace muy poco, los esfuerzos para medirlos y monitorearlos han estado muy desconectados. El trabajo en redes es esencial para descubrir las respuestas a preguntas que trascienden las fronteras y los plazos de las agencias de financiamiento. Aquí mostramos cómo una comunidad global está respondiendo a los desafíos de la investigación en ecosistemas tropicales a través de diversos equipos realizando mediciones árbol por árbol en miles de parcelas permanentes de largo plazo. Revisamos los descubrimientos más importantes de este trabajo y discutimos cómo este proceso está cambiando la ciencia relacionada a los bosques tropicales. El enfoque central de nuestro esfuerzo implica la conexión de iniciativas locales de largo plazo con protocolos estandarizados y manejo de datos para producir resultados que se puedan trasladar a múltiples escalas. Conectando investigadores tropicales, elevando su posición y estatus, nuestro modelo de Red Social de Investigación reconoce el rol fundamental que tienen, para el descubrimiento científico, quienes generan o producen los datos. Concebida en 1999 con RAINFOR (Suramérica), nuestras redes de parcelas permanentes han sido adaptadas en África (AfriTRON) y el sureste asiático (T-FORCES) y ampliamente replicadas en el mundo. Actualmente todas estas iniciativas están integradas a través de la ciber-infraestructura de ForestPlots.net, conectando colegas de 54 países en 24 redes diferentes de parcelas. Colectivamente, estas redes están transformando nuestro conocimiento sobre los bosques tropicales y el rol de éstos en la biósfera. Juntos hemos descubierto cómo, dónde y porqué el carbono y la biodiversidad de los bosques tropicales está respondiendo al cambio climático y cómo se retroalimentan. Esta colaboración pan-tropical de largo plazo ha expuesto un gran sumidero de carbono y sus tendencias, mostrando claramente cuáles son los factores más importantes, qué procesos se ven afectados, dónde ocurren los cambios, los tiempos de reacción y las probables respuestas futuras mientras el clima continúa cambiando. Apalancando lo que realmente es una tecnología antigua, las redes de parcelas están generando una verdadera y moderna revolución en la ciencia tropical. En el futuro, la humanidad puede beneficiarse enormemente si se nutren y cultivan comunidades de investigadores de base, actualmente con la capacidad de generar información única y de largo plazo para entender los que probablemente son los bosques más preciados de la tierra.\nResumo\nFlorestas tropicais são os ecossistemas mais diversos e produtivos da Terra. Embora uma boa compreensão destas florestas seja crucial para o nosso futuro coletivo, até muito recentemente os esforços de medições e monitoramento tem sido amplamente desconexos. É essencial formarmos redes para obtermos respostas que transcendam as fronteiras e horizontes das agências financiadoras. Neste estudo nós mostramos como uma comunidade global está respondendo aos desafios da pesquisa de ecossistemas tropicais, com equipes diversas medindo florestas, árvore por árvore, em milhares de parcelas monitoradas a longo prazo. Nós revisamos as maiores descobertas científicas deste esforço global, e mostramos também como este processo vem mudando a ciência de florestas tropicais. Nossa abordagem principal envolve unir iniciativas de base a protocolos padronizados e gerenciamento de dados a fim de gerar resultados robustos em grandes escalas. Ao conectar pesquisadores tropicais e elevar seus status, nosso modelo de Rede de Pesquisa Social reconhece o papel chave do produtor dos dados na descoberta científica. Concebida em 1999 com o RAINFOR (América do Sul), nossa rede de parcelas permanentes foi adaptada para África (AfriTRON) e Sudeste Asiático (T-FORCES), e tem sido extensamente reproduzida em todo o mundo. Agora estas múltiplas iniciativas estão integradas através da infraestrutura cibernética do ForestPlots.net, conectando colegas de 54 países e 24 redes de parcelas. Estas iniciativas estão transformando coletivamente o entendimento das florestas tropicais e seus papéis na biosfera. Juntos nós descobrimos como, onde e por que o carbono e a biodiversidade da floresta estão respondendo às mudanças climáticas, e seus efeitos de retroalimentação. Esta duradoura colaboração pantropical revelou um grande sumidouro de carbono persistente e suas tendências, assim como tem evidenciado quais os fatores que influenciam essas tendências, quais processos florestais são mais afetados, onde eles estão mudando, seus atrasos no tempo de resposta, e as prováveis respostas das florestas tropicais conforme o clima continua a mudar. Dessa forma, aproveitando uma notável tecnologia antiga, redes de parcelas acendem as faíscas de uma moderna revolução na ciência das florestas tropicais. No futuro a humanidade pode se beneficiar incentivando estas comunidades locais que agora são coletivamente capazes de gerar conhecimentos únicos e duradouros sobre as florestas mais preciosas da Terra.\nRésume\nLes forêts tropicales sont les écosystèmes les plus diversifiés et les plus productifs de la planète. Si une meilleure compréhension de ces forêts est essentielle pour notre avenir collectif, jusqu'à tout récemment, les efforts déployés pour les mesurer et les surveiller ont été largement déconnectés. La mise en réseau est essentielle pour découvrir les réponses à des questions qui dépassent les frontières et les horizons des organismes de financement. Nous montrons ici comment une communauté mondiale relève les défis de la recherche sur les écosystèmes tropicaux avec diverses équipes qui mesurent les forêts arbre après arbre dans de milliers de parcelles permanentes. Nous passons en revue les principales découvertes scientifiques de ces travaux et montrons comment ce processus modifie la science des forêts tropicales. Notre approche principale consiste à relier les initiatives de base à long terme à des protocoles standardisés et une gestion de données afin de générer des résultats solides à grande échelle. En reliant les chercheurs tropicaux et en élevant leur statut, notre modèle de réseau de recherche sociale reconnaît le rôle clé de l'auteur des données dans la découverte scientifique. Conçus en 1999 avec RAINFOR (Amérique du Sud), nos réseaux de parcelles permanentes ont été adaptés à l'Afrique (AfriTRON) et à l'Asie du Sud-Est (T-FORCES) et largement imités dans le monde entier. Ces multiples initiatives sont désormais intégrées via l'infrastructure ForestPlots.net, qui relie des collègues de 54 pays à travers 24 réseaux de parcelles. Ensemble, elles transforment la compréhension des forêts tropicales et de leur rôle biosphérique. Ensemble, nous avons découvert comment, où et pourquoi le carbone forestier et la biodiversité réagissent au changement climatique, et comment ils y réagissent. Cette collaboration pan-tropicale à long terme a révélé un important puits de carbone à long terme et ses tendances, tout en mettant en évidence les facteurs les plus importants, les processus forestiers qui sont affectés, les endroits où ils changent, les décalages et les réactions futures probables des forêts tropicales à mesure que le climat continue de changer. En tirant parti d'une technologie remarquablement ancienne, les réseaux de parcelles déclenchent une révolution très moderne dans la science des forêts tropicales. À l'avenir, l'humanité pourra grandement bénéficier du soutien des communautés de base qui sont maintenant collectivement capables de générer une compréhension unique et à long terme des forêts les plus précieuses de la Terre.\nAbstrak\nHutan tropika adalah di antara ekosistem yang paling produktif dan mempunyai kepelbagaian biodiversiti yang tinggi di seluruh dunia. Walaupun pemahaman mengenai hutan tropika amat penting untuk masa depan kita, usaha-usaha untuk mengkaji dan mengawas hutah-hutan tersebut baru sekarang menjadi lebih diperhubungkan. Perangkaian adalah sangat penting untuk mencari jawapan kepada soalan-soalan yang menjangkaui sempadan dan batasan agensi pendanaan. Di sini kami menunjukkan bagaimana sebuah komuniti global bertindak balas terhadap cabaran penyelidikan ekosistem tropika melalui penglibatan pelbagai kumpulan yang mengukur hutan secara pokok demi pokok dalam beribu-ribu plot jangka panjang. Kami meninjau semula penemuan saintifik utama daripada kerja ini dan menunjukkan bagaimana proses ini sedang mengubah bidang sains hutan tropika. Teras pendekatan kami memberi tumpuan terhadap penghubungan inisiatif akar umbi jangka panjang dengan protokol standar serta pengurusan data untuk mendapatkan hasil skala besar yang kukuh. Dengan menghubungkan penyelidik-penyelidik tropika dan meningkatkan status mereka, model Rangkaian Penyelidikan Sosial kami mengiktiraf kepentingan peranan pengasas data dalam penemuan saintifik. Bermula dengan pengasasan RAINFOR (Amerika Selatan) pada tahun 1999, rangkaian-rangkaian plot kekal kami kemudian disesuaikan untuk Afrika (AfriTRON) dan Asia Tenggara (T-FORCES) dan selanjutnya telah banyak dicontohi di seluruh dunia. Kini, inisiatif-inisiatif tersebut disepadukan melalui infrastruktur siber ForestPlots.net yang menghubungkan rakan sekerja dari 54 negara di 24 buah rangkaian plot. Secara kolektif, rangkaian ini sedang mengubah pemahaman tentang hutan tropika dan peranannya dalam biosfera. Kami telah bekerjasama untuk menemukan bagaimana, di mana dan mengapa karbon serta biodiversiti hutan bertindak balas terhadap perubahan iklim dan juga bagaimana mereka saling bermaklum balas. Kolaborasi pan-tropika jangka panjang ini telah mendedahkan sebuah sinki karbon jangka panjang serta arah alirannya dan juga menjelaskan pemandu-pemandu perubahan yang terpenting, di mana dan bagaimana proses hutan terjejas, masa susul yang ada dan kemungkinan tindakbalas hutan tropika pada perubahan iklim secara berterusan di masa depan. Dengan memanfaatkan pendekatan lama, rangkaian plot sedang menyalakan revolusi yang amat moden dalam sains hutan tropika. Pada masa akan datang, manusia sejagat akan banyak mendapat manfaat jika memupuk komuniti-komuniti akar umbi yang kini berkemampuan secara kolektif menghasilkan pemahaman unik dan jangka panjang mengenai hutan-hutan yang paling berharga di dunia.",

      "abstract": "Coasts contain a large and growing population and economy including world cities such as London, New York, Tokyo, Shanghai, Mumbai, Lagos, and Rio de Janeiro, as well as important habitats and their ecosystem services. Global sea levels are rising due to climate change and this will accelerate through this century: a rise of more than 1m is possible. In some locations these changes may be exacerbated by (1) increases in storminess due to climate change, although this is less certain, and (2) human-induced subsidence due to ground fluid withdrawal from and drainage of susceptible soils, especially in deltas and alluvial plains. Sea-level rise has a range of potential impacts including higher extreme sea levels (and flooding), coastal erosion, and salinization of surface and ground waters. This threatens the loss of large areas of land and associated assets and economic activity, the displacement of millions of people, and significant coastal habitat degradation. However, adaptation can greatly reduce these impacts and promote prosperous and desirable coasts. Adaptation measures can be characterized as (1) protect, (2) accommodate, or (3) retreat approaches. The provision of information measures such as warnings is improving significantly, while novel methods such as ecosystem-based approaches are attracting interest. Adaptation to sea-level rise should be viewed as a process that requires an integrated coastal management philosophy to be consistent with wider coastal activities and other stresses. Hence, in addition to technical skills, adaptation requires an appropriate institutional capacity. The success or failure of measures of adaptation, especially protection, is contested and this influences our view of sea-level rise as a problem. Adaptation can be best analyzed in the context of understanding the coastal system that includes the effects of all drivers, including sea-level rise, their interactions, and feedbacks: these types of analyses are only just beginning. Some proactive adaptation plans are already being formulated, such as around London and in the Netherlands. Coastal cities will be a major focus for adaptation efforts due to their concentrations of people and assets. However, there are important challenges for adaptation in developing countries, most especially in deltaic areas and small islands.",

      "abstract": "Economic and population growth have led to rapidly growing fuel consumption in South America. In order to supply this increasing demand while also using environmentally friendly and locally available feedstock, several countries have implemented the use of biofuels, in which biodiesel deserves special attention. While this alternative source of energy may reduce dependence on refining or importing fossil diesel, it also requires well-established policies and logistics for local industries to compete and succeed in producing a satisfactory quantity of biodiesel. This review compares the effectiveness of implemented policies in South American countries, providing a better understanding on cases of success and failure on the road to making biodiesel a regularly found fuel in the local transportation network. This assessment also clearly identifies different stages of development, pointing out that countries from the same region can have totally different outcomes according to political and market aspects. The main factors associated to cases of success, represented by Brazil, Argentina and Uruguay, were early implemented regulation policies, the solidity of local soybean industry and response to foreign competition. Finally, Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) is a new and efficient green fuel used in Diesel engines and will likely present additional challenges for this sector, potentially replacing both diesel and biodiesel in the fuel network, and posing a challenge to even the most stable biodiesel industries, along with the potential vehicle electrification.",

Index-based agricultural insurance (IBAI) is a particularly key example. Recent critical work has pointed to the deeply neoliberal character of IBAI and like interventions. However, the promotion of new financial instruments in response to crises of agrarian production has a much longer history in Africa and elsewhere. This article draws on Marx’s concept of ‘latent’ surplus populations to trace out and explain parallels between IBAI and colonial interventions in Senegal’s groundnut basin. Approaching the question in this way, the article highlights the long-run historical co-production and interdependence of the Senegalese state and a political ecology of groundnut production in which relations of indebtedness and the exposure to variable rainfall of a fragile relative surplus population has often been crucial to the mobilization of cheap labour for groundnut production. IBAI is thus positioned as part of a recurrent trajectory of emergency financial interventions aimed at smoothing out the contradictions implicit in this socio-ecological configuration.",

      "abstract": "Climate change and global recession have especially dramatic implications for small island developing states (SIDS). It is argued that such issues warrant urgent attention from researchers, policy-makers and the international development community. The existing literature relating to sustainable development in SIDS is limited in scope and rarely addresses the educational implications of sustainable development in significant depth. This paper draws upon recent theoretically and empirically grounded research carried out in collaboration with colleagues working within small states worldwide. The analysis examines how SIDS are responding to these contemporary global challenges, how the international community is engaging with such developments, and how education research and development co-operation might play more effective roles in advancing sustainable development in small state contexts. The paper concludes by exploring ways in which the wider international community may learn from the small states experience.",

      "abstract": "Tropical rainforests play a central role in the Earth system by regulating climate, maintaining biodiversity, and sequestering carbon. They are under threat by direct anthropogenic impacts like deforestation and the indirect anthropogenic impacts of climate change. A synthesis of the factors that determine the net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (NEE) at the site scale across different forests in the tropical rainforest biome has not been undertaken to date. Here, we study NEE and its components, gross ecosystem productivity (GEP) and ecosystem respiration (RE), across thirteen natural and managed forests within the tropical rainforest biome with 63 total site-years of eddy covariance data. Our results reveal that the five ecosystems with the largest annual gross carbon uptake by photosynthesis (i.e. GEP > 3000 g C m−2 y-1) have the lowest net carbon uptake – or even carbon losses – versus other study ecosystems because RE is of a similar magnitude. Sites that provided subcanopy CO2 storage observations had higher average magnitudes of GEP and RE and lower average magnitudes of NEE, highlighting the importance of measurement methodology for understanding carbon dynamics in ecosystems with characteristically tall and dense vegetation. A path analysis revealed that vapor pressure deficit (VPD) played a greater role than soil moisture or air temperature in constraining GEP under light saturated conditions across most study sites, but to differing degrees from -0.31 to -0.87 μmol CO2 m−2 s-1 hPa-1. Climate projections from 13 general circulation models (CMIP5) under the representative concentration pathway that generates 8.5 W m−2 of radiative forcing suggest that many current tropical rainforest sites on the lower end of the current temperature range are likely to reach a climate space similar to present-day warmer sites by the year 2050, warmer sites will reach a climate not currently experienced, and all forests are likely to experience higher VPD. Results demonstrate the need to quantify if and how mature tropical trees acclimate to heat and water stress, and to further develop flux-partitioning and gap-filling algorithms for defensible estimates of carbon exchange in tropical rainforests.",

      "abstract": "We present a set of indicators of vulnerability and capacity to adapt to climate variability, and by extension climate change, derived using a novel empirical analysis of data aggregated at the national level on a decadal timescale. The analysis is based on a conceptual framework in which risk is viewed in terms of outcome, and is a function of physically defined climate hazards and socially constructed vulnerability. Climate outcomes are represented by mortality from climate-related disasters, using the emergency events database data set, statistical relationships between mortality and a shortlist of potential proxies for vulnerability are used to identify key vulnerability indicators. We find that 11 key indicators exhibit a strong relationship with decadally aggregated mortality associated with climate-related disasters. Validation of indicators, relationships between vulnerability and adaptive capacity, and the sensitivity of subsequent vulnerability assessments to different sets of weightings are explored using expert judgement data, collected through a focus group exercise. The data are used to provide a robust assessment of vulnerability to climate-related mortality at the national level, and represent an entry point to more detailed explorations of vulnerability and adaptive capacity. They indicate that the most vulnerable nations are those situated in sub-Saharan Africa and those that have recently experienced conflict. Adaptive capacity—one element of vulnerability—is associated predominantly with governance, civil and political rights, and literacy.",

      "abstract": "The Neotropical region is recognized as one of the world's most important biodiversity-rich regions, especially its species-rich montane environments. The Neotropical freshwater crabs are notably diverse and are represented by three endemic families Epiloboceridae, Pseudothelphusidae, and Trichodactylidae. The first two families comprise the superfamily Pseudothephusoidea, which is principally associated with high-altitude environments, while the Trichodactylidae is found mainly in lowlying areas. The pseudothelphusids, or mountain crabs, are the main subject of this study. This family comprises 49 genera and 293 species and is the most threatened group because the freshwater environments in the Neotropics are increasingly threatened. The 2008 IUCN global conservation assessment found 15.5% of the superfamily Pseudothelphusoidea to be threatened with extinction and projected that in the worst-case scenario (if the Data Deficient species when eventually assessed are all in a threatened category), then the number of threatened species would be alarmingly high (72%). The reassessments presented here include more than 40 new species of pseudothelphusids that have been described since the first assessment, together with improved data on ecology, distribution, and threats. More than one-fifth (21.2%) of Neotropical pseudothelphusoids were found to be threatened with extinction, notably in South America where the threats are all associated with the rapid growth of the human population in montane environments. The principal threats to pseudothelphusids include deforestation, water pollution, and dam construction. Additionally, this study shows the need for more studies on freshwater crab ecology, population trends, and threats that can in turn be used to formulate urgently needed conservation action plans.",

These viruses form a very diverse group, and in Brazil, arboviruses belonging to the families Flaviviridae and Togaviridae are predominant. Unfortunately, the number of arboviruses increases in proportion with factors such as deforestation, poor sanitation, climate changes, and introduction of new viruses like Chikungunya virus and Zika virus. In Brazil, dengue is endemic, along with the presence of other arboviruses. The situation is complicated by the scarcity of diagnostic infrastructure and the absence of approved vaccines for these diseases. Disease control, thus, relies solely on vector control.

For decades, significant financial investment has been given to mangrove rehabilitation/restoration in seafronts, reversion of abandoned ponds, and transformation of seagrass beds and other subtidal habitats. Complementary to these onsite interventions are economic instruments (e.g., payments for ecological services, corporate social responsibility of industry) and international policies (e.g., Ramsar Convention, Sendai Framework).

      "abstract": "Globally, species ranges are shifting in response to climate change. For black mangrove (Avicennia germinans), fewer severe freeze events in a warming climate facilitate poleward range expansion into temperate coastal salt marshes, however propagules that disperse into marshes encounter biotic interactions (e.g., predation) that affect their survival and subsequent forest development. To better understand the relative roles of climate, predation, and propagule dispersal in shaping A. germinans range expansion, we developed a stage-based population model that tested forest stand establishment and survival under differing scenarios of freeze regime, predation pressure, and propagule dispersal. Predation parameters were developed from a field experiment that tested propagule density-predation intensity relationships for purple marsh crab (Sesarma reticulatum), which showed proportional propagule consumption decreased with increased propagule density. Model outcomes demonstrated all measures of mangrove stand development and regeneration decreased with increased freeze and predation intensities, modulated by propagule dispersal density and frequency. Regenerating stands were more likely to recover from freezes under a reduced freeze regime compared to a historical freeze regime, but moderate and high predation intensities hindered stand development and recovery across freeze regimes. Maintaining a regenerating stand generally required recurring dispersal events. While several studies have investigated the individual effects of freezes, predation pressure, and dispersal on mangrove ranges, our model is the first effort of which we are aware that quantifies the combined effects of all three controls. The model can thus serve as a tool for understanding patterns of A. germinans range expansion in the Big Bend and other regions under future warming.",

      "abstract": "The estimation and monitoring of the huge amount of carbon contained in tropical forests, and specifically in the above-ground biomass (AGB) of trees, is needed for the successful implementation of climate change mitigation strategies. Its accuracy depends on the availability of reliable allometric equations to convert forest inventory data into AGB estimates. In this study, we tested whether central African forests are really different from other tropical forests with respect to biomass allometry, and further examined the regional variation in tropical tree allometry across the Congo basin forests. Following the same standardized protocol, trees were destructively sampled for AGB in six sites representative of terra firme forests. We fitted regional and local allometric models, including tree diameter, wood specific gravity, tree height, and crown radius in the AGB predictors. We also evaluated the AGB predictions at the tree level across the six sites of our new models and of existing allometric models, including the pantropical equations developed by Chave et al. (2014, 2005) and the local equations developed by Ngomanda et al. (2014) in Gabon. With a total of 845 tropical trees belonging to 55 African species and covering a large range of diameters (up to 200 cm), the original data presented here can be considered as the largest ever destructive sampling for a tropical region. Regional allometric models were established and including tree height and crown radius had a small but significant effect on AGB predictions. In contrast to our expectations, tree height and crown radius did not explain much between-site variation. Examining the performance of general models (pantropical or regional) versus local models (site-specific), we found little advantage of using local equations. Earlier pantropical equations developed for moist forests were found to provide reasonable predictions of tree AGB in most sites, though the wettest sites, i.e., evergreen forests in Equatorial Guinea and, to a lesser extent in Gabon, tended to show a wet forest allometry. For the Congo basin forests, except in Equatorial Guinea where local models might be preferred, we recommend using our regional models, and otherwise the most recent pantropical models, that were validated here. These results constitute a critical step for the estimation and monitoring of biomass/carbon stocks contained in the second largest contiguous block of tropical forests worldwide, and the successful implementation of climate change mitigation strategies, such as REDD+.",

      "abstract": "Currently, risk assessments related to rising sea levels and the adoption of defensive or adaptive measures to counter these sea level increases are underway for densely populated deltas where economic losses might be important, especially in the developed world. However, many underpopulated deltas harbouring high biological and cultural diversity are also at risk but will most likely continue to be ignored as conservation targets. In this study, we explore the potential effects of erosion, inundation and salinisation on one of the world's comparatively underpopulated megadeltas, the Orinoco Delta. With a 1m sea level rise expected to occur by 2100, several models predict a moderate erosion of the delta's shorelines, migration or loss of mangroves, general inundation of the delta with an accompanying submersion of wetlands, and an increase in the distance to which sea water intrudes into streams, resulting in harm to the freshwater biota and resources. The Warao people are the indigenous inhabitants of the Orinoco Delta and currently are subject to various socioeconomic stressors. Changes due to sea level rise will occur extremely rapidly and cause abrupt shifts in the Warao's traditional environments and resources, resulting in migrations and abandonment of their ancestral territories. However, evidence indicates that deltaic aggradation/accretion processes at the Orinoco delta due to allochthonous sediment input and vegetation growth could be elevating the surface of the land, keeping pace with the local sea level rise. Other underpopulated and large deltas of the world also may risk immeasurable biodiversity and cultural losses and should not be forgotten as important conservation targets.",

      "abstract": "Global change is resetting the spatial and ecological equilibrium of complex co-evolutionary relationships between plants and their insect herbivores. We review the mechanisms at play in the responses of plant–insect interactions to global changes, including increased temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentrations, modification of land use and pollution. We distinguish between the direct effects of global changes on each partner from the indirect impacts on insects via the responses of plants. The indirect effects include a change in the nutritional quality of the plant tissues for herbivore insects, as well as a change in the microclimatic conditions at the leaf surface. Pollinators are involved in a close symbiotic relationship with their favourite plants, and any depression caused by climate stress can lead to pollination deficit. Pollinators are, indeed, quite sensitive to global changes. Furthermore, although species are connected by trophic links, all species respond differently to global changes. We highlight that more research is needed to elucidate the plant-mediated indirect effects of climate change on insects. Then, other human activities, such as land transformations and release of pollutants, are likely to modulate these links between climate and plant–insect relationships. We argue that predicting the net effect of global change on plant–insect relationships requires a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms that modulate the interaction strength between the plants and the insects, rather than on focusing on each partner individually.",

      "abstract": "Changes in the strength and position of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) are an important component of climate variability in the tropical Atlantic. The Cariaco Basin, located on the northern margin of Venezuela, is sensitive to tropical Atlantic climate change and its sediments provide a record of past ITCZ behavior. Today, the Cariaco Basin experiences two distinct seasons that reflect the annual migration of the Atlantic ITCZ. Between January and March, when the ITCZ lies south of the equator, northeasterly trade winds sit directly over Cariaco Basin and strong coastal upwelling and dry conditions dominate. Beginning in June–July, as the ITCZ moves north, local rainfall reaches a maximum and the upwelling diminishes or disappears. Here we summarize new and previously published data on the river-derived terrigenous fraction of Cariaco Basin sediments, as well as comparisons to other paleoclimate records, which together suggest a coherent climatologic response in the tropical Atlantic triggered by a pattern of ITCZ migration that mimics the seasonal cycle. During periods of cooler North Atlantic SSTs, on time-scales ranging from the Little Ice Age to the Younger Dryas to the cold stadials of the last glacial, decreased detrital delivery to Cariaco Basin from local rivers suggests a southward shift in the mean latitudinal position of the ITCZ. During warm interstadials and periods of Holocene and deglacial warmth, northward shifts in ITCZ position and its belt of convective rainfall are inferred from increased detrital delivery to the basin. Whether the rapid shifts in ITCZ position and precipitation recorded by Cariaco Basin sediments and other regional records reflect a response to forcing originating in the high latitude Atlantic or to forcing potentially sourced in the tropics is a key question yet to be fully answered.",

      "abstract": "Extreme hydrological events (EHEs), such as droughts and floods, vary spatially and temporally in nature. The increase in the number of events in the last few decades has motivated the research of the spatiotemporal variability of the future extreme precipitation and temperature. To study the consequences on the EHEs due to the uncertainty of projected climate changes, the analysis in more detail of precipitation and temperature, in space and time, is vital. In addition, for proper planning and decision-making process to address EHEs, understanding such climate changes requires more information. In this chapter we present a summarized assessment of the spatiotemporal variations of climate projections. A simplified way to aggregate global data is used for the spatiotemporal analysis of precipitation and temperature. To carry out this analysis, the Spatio-TempoRal distribution and Interannual VarIability of projections (STRIVIng) toolbox is proposed for statistical exploratory analysis of climate projections. Three large-scale applications were carried out for illustration: Dominican Republic (48,670km2), Mexico (1,972,550km2), and Amazon basin (6,171,148.7km2). The methodology and toolbox presented here allow regions to be identified where the changes are expected to be more severe on precipitation and temperature, as well as months in which those changes are likely to occur. The STRIVIng toolbox is open source and helps to provide basic information to increase the interpretations and research in the space–time analysis of extremes.",

      "abstract": "Documenting the Neotropical amphibian diversity has become a major challenge facing the threat of global climate change and the pace of environmental alteration. Recent molecular phylogenetic studies have revealed that the actual number of species in South American tropical forests is largely underestimated, but also that many lineages are millions of years old. The genera Phyzelaphryne (1 sp.) and Adelophryne (6 spp.), which compose the subfamily Phyzelaphryninae, include poorly documented, secretive, and minute frogs with an unusual distribution pattern that encompasses the biotic disjunction between Amazonia and the Atlantic forest. We generated >5.8kb sequence data from six markers for all seven nominal species of the subfamily as well as for newly discovered populations in order to (1) test the monophyly of Phyzelaphryninae, Adelophryne and Phyzelaphryne, (2) estimate species diversity within the subfamily, and (3) investigate their historical biogeography and diversification. Phylogenetic reconstruction confirmed the monophyly of each group and revealed deep subdivisions within Adelophryne and Phyzelaphryne, with three major clades in Adelophryne located in northern Amazonia, northern Atlantic forest and southern Atlantic forest. Our results suggest that the actual number of species in Phyzelaphryninae is, at least, twice the currently recognized species diversity, with almost every geographically isolated population representing an anciently divergent candidate species. Such results highlight the challenges for conservation, especially in the northern Atlantic forest where it is still degraded at a fast pace. Molecular dating revealed that Phyzelaphryninae originated in Amazonia and dispersed during early Miocene to the Atlantic forest. The two Atlantic forest clades of Adelophryne started to diversify some 7Ma minimum, while the northern Amazonian Adelophryne diversified much earlier, some 13Ma minimum. This striking biogeographic pattern coincides with major events that have shaped the face of the South American continent, as we know it today.",

      "abstract": "The Pantepui biogeographical province has been defined on the basis of present-day orographic and biotic features. In this chapter we ask whether Pantepui as a biogeographical unit has remained invariable through the Quaternary in spite of the glacial–interglacial cyclicity typical of this geological period. For this purpose, we split the Pantepui concept into three main components, namely the orographic, the climatic, and the biotic. The existing paleoecological evidence suggests that these three Pantepui components have been recurrently assembled and disassembled during interglacial and glacial phases, respectively. This is called here the Pantepui oscillator. Glacial climates have been dominant and are considered the norm during the Quaternary, whereas interglacials are viewed as abrupt warmings maintained by external energy inputs derived from positive feedbacks exacerbating solar forcing. As a consequence, interglacial Pantepui assembly may be viewed as an abrupt and comparatively short-lived unstable biogeographical state that is disrupted during glaciations, leading to a more stable state characterized by the disassembly of the orographic, climatic, and biotic Pantepui components. It follows that, rather than a present-day static biogeographical unit, Pantepui is a dynamic concept where biotic variations are linked to climatic peculiarities of each interglacial period, as well as species’ idiosyncratic responses, including eventual speciation and extinction events. The oscillator concept is used to forecast the potential state of Pantepui as a biogeographical unit in the near future under the global warming predicted for the end of this century.",

      "abstract": "There are well established strategies for measuring fuel poverty in developed countries based on heating factors correlated with household income (expenditure, heating restriction or cold houses), but they do not translate well to tropical regions where climatic conditions and socioeconomic contexts entail different energy use. Fuel poverty in tropical regions has never been defined. We propose a new framework for the identification of fuel-poor households based on Sen's capability approach. We employ latent class model (LCM) methodology to accurately assess fuel poverty in tropical areas using observable objective characteristics of decent, safe and healthy dwellings. This approach enables us to categorize households as fuel-poor or fuel-sufficient. It is also possible to extend the model further by considering the multi-dimensional phenomenon of fuel poverty. We find that the most deprived represent approximately 12% of the population, while 32% of the population is expected to belong to the fuel-sufficient class. An intermediate class encompassing 56% of the population represents vulnerable households that could easily be affected by an exogenous shock. Energy deprivation is much more complex and multidimensional than a binary phenomenon, implying that fuel poverty can be measured with different degrees of exposure. With this research, we enable policy makers to identify a target group of households that should be a top priority in fighting fuel poverty in tropical regions.",

      "abstract": "The habitat use by two neighboring coastal bottlenose dolphin communities (Posorja and El Morro) was evaluated in the western inner estuary of the Gulf of Guayaquil, Ecuador (3°S, 80°55′W). The study aimed to determine to what extent some environmental variables influence dolphins' distribution and behavior. The analysis included 344 dolphin groups recorded between 2014 and 2019. For both dolphin communities, 95% of home ranges were estimated (23.5 km2 Posorja and 44.8 km2, El Morro). Home ranges overlapped in an area of 11.2 km2. No clear preference for areas to carry out specific activities was found, as dolphins used the same areas for multiple purposes. Multinomial logistic regression with four environmental parameters (distance to shore, depth, hour of day and tide) were used as predictor variables of behavior. A significant relationship between the tidal cycle and behavioral states was found with feeding occurring more frequently during the low tide, socializing and transit during high tide, and resting during mid-tide. Count models were used with environmental and behavioral variables to explore their relationship with dolphins' group size. Differences with respect to dolphin counts were associated with tide height and socialization. Depth is relevant for predicting dolphin counts mainly during high tide. We recommend that environmental authorities consider the dolphins' preference to carry out their activities within small home ranges, identify overlapping human activities and take steps to reduce potential conflicts, such as prohibiting all types of gillnets in areas of high concentration of dolphins. Likewise, regular assessments are required to detect future changes in both dolphins' habitat and human uses over time.",

      "abstract": "As the world takes an unprecedented rural–urban population tilt, the 21st century poses a challenge in further tinkering the internationally evident disparities in access and allocation of carbon. Traditionally, inequalities have been negotiated from economic or ‘state of development’ perspective. This research, to our knowledge is the first of its kind that plots carbon emission of over 200 nations/territories against a spatial framework. The study argues that existing dualities in the international climate change governance, evident in the so called global ‘North–South’ economic divide, has a stronger component of ‘Urban–Rural’ spatial disparity in the making, which is likely to further precipitate into a much local but complex dynamic, particularly relevant to the developing world, that face the double challenge of rapid urbanization and environmental sustainability. The paper discusses the ethical, empirical and governance gaps in climate governance related to the urban–rural carbon dynamics and conclude with a future pathway, committed to procedural justice and sub-nationalization of carbon governance, fairly acknowledging carbon flows at the local level through standard inventories based on consumption criteria. The research offers a shifting paradigm in global climate governance, in view of the inclusion of cities as Goal 11 within the upcoming sustainable development goals and the UNFCCC COP21 to be held in Paris in 2015 and beyond.",

      "abstract": "Mountainous areas host a disproportionately large fraction of Earth's biodiversity, suggesting a causal relationship between mountain building and biological diversification. Mountain clade radiations are generally associated with changes in environment, climate, and the increase in heterogeneity therein during mountain building. However, examining the causal relationship between mountain building and diversification is a complex challenge, because isolating the effects of surface uplift from other abiotic (climate) or biotic variables is not straightforward. In this study, we investigate the relative contributions of abiotic climate-driven (temperature) and geology-driven (elevation) drivers on evolutionary rates of ancient groups of organisms in the South American Andes. We present regional curves of Andean elevation based on a recent compilation of paleo-elevational data back to the Late Cretaceous, and analyse the diversification history of six Andean frog and lizard families that originated equally far back in time. For two clades (Aromobatidae and Leptodactylidae), we find that they diversified most rapidly during the early phase of mountain building (Late Cretaceous - Paleogene), when the first high-elevation habitats emerged in South America. The diversification of one clade (Centrolenidae) is correlated with Cenozoic temperature variations, with higher speciation rates during warm periods. The last three clades (Dendrobatidae, Hemiphractidae and Liolaemidae) are best explained by environment-independent diversification, although for Liolaemidae, an almost equally strong positive correlation was found between speciation and Andean elevation since the late Eocene. Our findings imply that throughout the long-lived history of surface uplift in the Andes, mountain building drove the diversification of different clades at different times, while not directly affecting other clades. Our study illustrates the importance of paleogeographic reconstructions that capture the complexity and heterogeneity of mountain building in our understanding of the effects that a changing environment plays in shaping biodiversity patterns observed today.",

This study has determined the canopy height and above-ground biomass of Indian tropical forest plantation by the space-borne TanDEM-X Polarimetric Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data using the physical scattering model and machine learning. The complex coherence estimated using TanDEM-X datasets of December month was found most appropriate for inversion of canopy height. The best canopy height accuracy (R2 = 0.79, RMSE = 1.66 m) was achieved by the TanDEM-X pair with vertical wavenumber (Kz) 0.18 at a 27.31° incidence angle in Random Volume over Ground model. The Random Forest model selects 12 optimal parameters from 42 variables (e.g. Canopy height, alpha angle, and coherence, etc.) for spatial prediction of AGB. Observed and predicted AGB showed R2 = 0.83 and RMSE = 27 Mg ha−1. The canopy height explained the maximum variation in AGB than other TanDEM-X variables in the ML algorithm.",

      "abstract": "The Amazon coastal zone has become contaminated with organic pollutants, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). However, information about their distribution and sources in this area is scarce, despite increasing deforestation and oil exploitation. Therefore, individual PAHs were analysed in the sediments of the Oyapock estuary, which is located in the Amazon coastal zone. This study provides information about the spatial and short-term temporal distributions of PAHs and discusses the major sources of PAHs to better understand the anthropogenic processes occurring in adjacent areas. The concentrations of all sixteen priority PAHs defined by the US EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency, ∑16PAHs) ranged from 10.9 to 138.8 ng g−1 with a mean and standard deviation = 37.9 ± 20.5 and indicated that this estuary is not contaminated, while the mean levels were similar to those found in other Amazon regions and pristine areas along the coast of Brazil. No significant differences were found in the sedimentary PAHs levels between the wet and dry sampling campaigns, despite the different climatic conditions. Diagnostic ratios, positive matrix factorization (PMF) and cluster analysis have shown that the majority of the investigated PAHs were derived from combustion processes (at least 55.1%, as estimated by the PMF model). Localized source inputs from oil and its by-products concomitantly with natural/biogenic sources appear to be secondary sources. The PAH contribution from biomass and wood combustion was approximately 13.6% and was relatively lower than other regions of the Amazon that are undergoing massive biomass burning. As the first study of PAHs in this region, this study provides vital information on the healthy state of the estuary and can serve as a baseline for assessing the impacts of acute oil disasters or the chronic input of PAHs as a result of human settlements.",

      "abstract": "Recent research introduced the concept of climate storylines as an alternative approach to estimate climate impact and better deal with uncertainties. A climate storyline is an event-based approach which aims at building “physically self-consistent unfolding of past events, or of plausible future events or pathways”. As such, climate storylines may profit from downward counterfactual thinking, which aims at analyzing how past events could have been worse. Notwithstanding the various applications of downward counterfactual thinking in the natural risk management literature, no study relates this with the climate storyline approach. The main goal of this paper is thus to introduce a framework that supports the development of climate storylines from downward counterfactuals. The framework is event-oriented, it focuses on impact, and it is designed to be applied in a participatory fashion. As a proof-of-concept application, we study the impact of tropical cyclones on the European Union Solidarity Fund (EUSF) without conducting a participatory analysis. Tropical cyclones represent a serious threat for the European outermost regions, and their impact to the EUSF capital availability has never been studied. We find that payouts due to tropical cyclones can hamper a recovery of the fund if large payouts concurrently occur in mainland Europe. To avoid this also considering future changes, an increase in capitalization up to 90 % percent may be required.",

      "abstract": "The primary objective of the European Space Agency's 7th Earth Explorer mission, BIOMASS, is to determine the worldwide distribution of forest above-ground biomass (AGB) in order to reduce the major uncertainties in calculations of carbon stocks and fluxes associated with the terrestrial biosphere, including carbon fluxes associated with Land Use Change, forest degradation and forest regrowth. To meet this objective it will carry, for the first time in space, a fully polarimetric P-band synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Three main products will be provided: global maps of both AGB and forest height, with a spatial resolution of 200 m, and maps of severe forest disturbance at 50 m resolution (where “global” is to be understood as subject to Space Object tracking radar restrictions). After launch in 2022, there will be a 3-month commissioning phase, followed by a 14-month phase during which there will be global coverage by SAR tomography. In the succeeding interferometric phase, global polarimetric interferometry Pol-InSAR coverage will be achieved every 7 months up to the end of the 5-year mission. Both Pol-InSAR and TomoSAR will be used to eliminate scattering from the ground (both direct and double bounce backscatter) in forests. In dense tropical forests AGB can then be estimated from the remaining volume scattering using non-linear inversion of a backscattering model. Airborne campaigns in the tropics also indicate that AGB is highly correlated with the backscatter from around 30 m above the ground, as measured by tomography. In contrast, double bounce scattering appears to carry important information about the AGB of boreal forests, so ground cancellation may not be appropriate and the best approach for such forests remains to be finalized. Several methods to exploit these new data in carbon cycle calculations have already been demonstrated. In addition, major mutual gains will be made by combining BIOMASS data with data from other missions that will measure forest biomass, structure, height and change, including the NASA Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation lidar deployed on the International Space Station after its launch in December 2018, and the NASA-ISRO NISAR L- and S-band SAR, due for launch in 2022. More generally, space-based measurements of biomass are a core component of a carbon cycle observation and modelling strategy developed by the Group on Earth Observations. Secondary objectives of the mission include imaging of sub-surface geological structures in arid environments, generation of a true Digital Terrain Model without biases caused by forest cover, and measurement of glacier and icesheet velocities. In addition, the operations needed for ionospheric correction of the data will allow very sensitive estimates of ionospheric Total Electron Content and its changes along the dawn-dusk orbit of the mission.",

      "abstract": "Afforestation is a process used in recovering the global mangrove cover. Succession or development in mangrove communities during mangrove afforestation has rarely been described yet is important for understanding the potential of afforestation in creating diverse and functional mangroves. Since 1966, the Government of Bangladesh has created nearly 280 km2 of plantation mangroves (7.5% of the extent of the Sundarbans mangrove forest and 0.21% of the global mangroves extent) on the Delta of the Ganges, Brahmaputra and Meghna Rivers, located east of the Sundarbans mangroves. Here, we investigated the development of these plantation mangroves, assessing their community structure and species richness over a 40-year chronosequence in comparison to natural mangroves in the same region. Tree communities in the plantations reached a maximum mean aboveground biomass (AGB) of ∼157 ± 13 Mg dry weight ha−1, achieving equivalence in tree aboveground biomass and tree density (255 ± 2 individuals ha−1) to natural mangroves by 20 and 39 years respectively. Our dataset from plantations aged between 10 and 42 years indicated that structural complexity (Ic) was higher in older plantations than in younger plantations. We found that the tree community structure of older mangrove plantations was more diverse in the eastern region of the delta compared to the central and western regions, and the landward plantations were more diverse than the plantations fringing the oceans. One of the originally planted mangrove species, Sonneratia apetala, was dominant in these plantations. However, we recorded 8 mangrove tree species from 5 genera in the plantations, despite only two species (S. apetala and Avicennia officinalis) being planted. Our data indicated that while the tree structure of the established mangrove plantations was similar to natural mangroves within 42 years, equivalent species richness may not be reached for more than 40 years. Therefore, adoption of management to enhance natural successional or development processes in afforestation programs, for example by planting a diverse mix of species, could improve the effectiveness of afforestation in conserving biodiversity.",

      "abstract": "The small quantity of basic studies like age and growth estimates implies a lack of stock assessments and difficulties to make decisions related to fisheries management and biodiversity conservation. Therefore, we extensively and systematically reviewed the growth parameters of freshwater species from South America, with the following objectives: verify the existence of taxonomic patterns between asymptotic length and the growth coefficient; summarize the principal methods used and identify tendencies in their use; analyze the time between collection of the data and publication of the results; and verify possible latitudinal patterns in asymptotic length and the growth coefficient. A total of 199 articles covering 259 species were found. This work demonstrates the main gaps in the age and growth studies of freshwater fish from South America. Although there are well-studied basins such as Parana and some parts of the Amazon, most of the ecoregions remain without information or basic studies, and show the need for efforts to improve this situation to better understand the population dynamics of the species. Considering the L∞-K relationship, no evident latitudinal patterns were found, not even for species of the same order. Still, despite the wide use that the growth parameters have in the most diverse models and population studies, our analyses show that the data take a long time to be published, making more applied management and conservation studies unfeasible or, at least, harder. Finally, growth parameter data can contribute to minimize the lack of stock assessments, providing important information for use in management and biodiversity conservation.",

      "abstract": "The first decade of the new millennium saw a boom in rubber prices. This led to rapid and widespread land conversion to monoculture rubber plantations in continental SE Asia, where natural rubber production has increased >50% since 2000. Here, we analyze the subsequent spread of rubber between 2005 and 2010 in combination with environmental data and reports on rubber plantation performance. We show that rubber has been planted into increasingly sub-optimal environments. Currently, 72% of plantation area is in environmentally marginal zones where reduced yields are likely. An estimated 57% of the area is susceptible to insufficient water availability, erosion, frost, or wind damage, all of which may make long-term rubber production unsustainable. In 2013 typhoons destroyed plantations worth US$ >250 million in Vietnam alone, and future climate change is likely to lead to a net exacerbation of environmental marginality for both current and predicted future rubber plantation area. New rubber plantations are also frequently placed on lands that are important for biodiversity conservation and ecological functions. For example, between 2005 and 2010 >2500km2 of natural tree cover and 610km2 of protected areas were converted to plantations. Overall, expansion into marginal areas creates potential for loss-loss scenarios: clearing of high-biodiversity value land for economically unsustainable plantations that are poorly adapted to local conditions and alter landscape functions (e.g. hydrology, erosion) – ultimately compromising livelihoods, particularly when rubber prices fall.",

      "abstract": "Arbacia is unique among shallow echinoid genus, not in line with the general rule that sea urchins should be either entirely tropical or entirely temperate, with limited overlap in the subtropics. Six extant Arbacia species have been described by Mortensen. The genus Arbacia has a Neotropical origin and four different fossil species have been described from the Late Miocene. Over the past century, Arbacia has been the subject of intense investigations into the cell biology, toxicology, biochemistry, and embryology. Recently, renewed interest in this genus arose from its phylogeny, ecology, and its resilience to ocean warming and acidification. According to several studies, impacts of ocean acidification on Arbacia, growth from the juvenile to mature adult life-stage transition, seems to be mitigated by warming. Functional studies have shown that some Arbacia species play an important role in the ecology of rocky reefs. Manipulative experiments have shown a leading role of Arbacia species in maintaining the coralline barren habitat. All species of Arbacia are omnivorous, with a strong tendency to carnivory. They are able to scrape fleshy algae, sea grasses, encrusting algae, barnacle shells, and hard calcareous tubes of polychaetes from the substrata, thanks to their large Aristotle's lantern, indicative of a durophagic habit. Arbacia is a gonochoric genus with a very early maturity. Generally, Arbacia species show a reproductive cycle that is typically annual or semiannual.",

      "abstract": "The occurrence of rapid last glacial temperature shifts in both Greenland ice and subpolar marine sediment cores, so-called Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O) cycles, is evidence of a tight regional climate connectivity in these northern latitudes. By contrast, processes behind high-to-low-latitude teleconnections during the D-O cycles are less well understood, due to imprecisions in cross-dating marine and ice core records and a general lack of solid multi-proxy records from the tropical region. Here we aim to study the response of the tropical ocean-atmosphere system to D-O variability by using a sediment core from the southern Caribbean Sea, located under the direct influence of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC). During D-O cycles, abrupt shifts in the deposition of fine-grained terrigenous material sourced from the Orinoco and Amazon rivers are recognized. These sedimentary changes were associated with fluctuations in both the ITCZ location and the AMOC strength through their respective influence on the hydroclimate of northern South America and strength of ocean currents delivering fluvial material to the study site. Stable oxygen isotope data further suggest increase in the upper ocean temperatures in the southeastern Caribbean Sea during stadial events. As these warming trends correlate with Antarctic temperatures, they seem to contain imprints of the bipolar seesaw and AMOC variability, demonstrating that our core location was influenced by processes prevalent in both hemispheres.",

      "abstract": "Recently published time-calibrated molecular phylogenies have brought to light a large-scale biotic interchange between the Western and Eastern Amazon basins, associated with the late Neogene (c. 10–4.5 Ma) uplift of the Northern Andes and formation of the modern transcontinental Amazon river. This important macroevolutionary event was previously overlooked due to poor understanding of alpha taxonomy and geographic distributions, lack of species-dense phylogenetic analyses, and insufficient methods for estimating biogeographic range evolution and lineage divergence times. Rapid improvements in all these areas have now provided the community with a corpus of historical biogeographic studies using species-dense and time-calibrated molecular phylogenies of plant and animal taxa distributed across Greater Amazonia. In this study we present historical biogeographic analyses of two clades of freshwater fishes (potamotrygonid stingrays and apteronotid electric fishes), and synthesize these results with those of 18 other published studies of Amazonian taxa, including riverine and upland (terra firme) clades of plants (n = 5), insects (n = 2), and representatives of all five vertebrate classes; i.e. fishes (n = 4) amphibians (n = 3), non-avian reptiles (n = 2), birds (n = 2), and mammals (n = 2). Our results support the hypothesis that tectonically-driven megariver capture events facilitated a massive biotic interchange between the Western and Eastern Amazon basins, which we name the Great Amazonian Biotic Interchange. These same megacapture events also separated the modern Amazon and Orinoco basins, contributing to the biotic distinctiveness of these megadiverse regions, and thereby elevating the total biodiversity of Greater Amazonia. The results highlight the role of large and rare (Black Swan) landscape evolution events in preserving and promoting biodiversity that had accumulated over tens of millions of years and across the whole of the South American continental platform.",

      "abstract": "This study is intended to attain preliminary estimates on the potential for carbon credits for Small hydropower (SHP) projects in the Brazilian overview, which was divided into two phases. In Phase I, a comparative analysis was conducted of accumulated CO2 emission values by the expansion of gross annual sources of coal and the accumulated CO2 emission values from the expansion of the gross annual installed capacity of SHP for two scenarios, Scenario 1 and Scenario 2. The results demonstrated the advantages of using SHP as an energy source, with regards to greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions, despite the uncertainty of the values of GHG emission factors. Phase II presents a case study based on data from a real time series for a station located in southern Minas Gerais State with an arbitrary value for the design head of the venture. The calculation of Permanency Power, Energy Curve, and values of Optimum Hydraulic Power Available (MW) and Optimum Flow Available (m3/s) was made possible by the Microsoft® Excel® spreadsheet from CERPCH [11]. The calculation of net income derived from carbon credit for SHP projects was done through the Microsoft® Excel® spreadsheet from Michellis Junior [18], based on the CDM guidelines as recommended in the UN Convention on Climate Change, Ministry of Science and Technology. The results showed that the net revenues obtained for carbon credits in SHP projects located in the Isolated System were well above those obtained in the National Interconnected System.",

      "abstract": "Tropical deforestation continues to be the major driver of biodiversity loss and a considerable contributor to climate change. Increasing numbers of forest-dependent rural poor rely on degraded forest for their livelihoods. Ecological restoration of tropical forests has the potential to not only contribute to biodiversity conservation and climate mitigation, but also poverty alleviation. REDD+ provides a potentially powerful mechanism for supporting ecological restoration of tropical forests in developing countries. Decisions on when and how forest restoration activities should be implemented will require a detailed understanding of the ecological and socioeconomic context of the particular region. This paper focuses on three seed-related ecological traits of tropical trees which limit the likelihood of natural regeneration of degraded secondary forest or the recovery of abandoned agricultural land. These factors may also provide significant constraints to restoration through direct seeding and planting. A comprehensive review of 367 papers was conducted to evaluate masting phenology, seed storage and seed dispersal distances across important tropical timber tree families. This information is synthesised to identify the implications of these seed-related traits for ecological restoration of tropical forests and its integration into the REDD+ framework. Phenological monitoring, targeted nursery capacity building with a focus on recalcitrant and threatened timber species, the promotion of trees within the agricultural matrix, and conservation of remnant trees, are all important considerations. There is a major gap in our understanding of seed dispersal in heterogeneous landscapes, which must be addressed if we are to develop sustainable strategies for restoration in human dominated landscapes.",

      "abstract": "Pantepui harbors exceptional biodiversity and endemism whose origins remain largely unknown. This chapter reviews the existing hypotheses on the origin and evolution of the Pantepui biota in light of the available biogeographical, paleoecological, and molecular phylogenetic evidence. Most (but not all) of the existing theories and hypotheses were developed by earlier zoologists based on biogeographical patterns, and further studies have aimed mainly at testing these ideas. Botanists have rarely mentioned these theories, although they have sometimes used similar proposals to explain the origin of Pantepui flora. Earlier studies on the origin of the Pantepui biota reproduced the classical biogeographical debate between vicariance and dispersalism. Paleoecological study added a more dynamic vision based on Quaternary evidence and showed that elements of both the vicariant and dispersalist hypotheses were needed to understand Pantepui biotic patterns. The advent of molecular phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses allowed the dating of speciation events and the resolution of their spatial components, thus providing critical evidence for both Quaternary and pre-Quaternary diversification trends. The available multidisciplinary evidence shows that the spatiotemporal diversification trends vary among the different taxonomic groups, which makes a single theory on the origin of the Pantepui biota unattainable. As occurs in the Neotropics in general, proper understanding of the origin of Pantepui biotic patterns requires complex thinking and the consideration of multiple drivers, as well as a diversity of ecological and evolutionary processes and mechanisms acting across spatial and temporal scales. A coordinated multidisciplinary effort is needed for a more comprehensive and realistic framework for understanding the origin and evolution of the Pantepui biota.",

      "abstract": "This short communication highlights potential destabilisation of the muddy coast of Guyana, South America, caused by large-scale mangrove destruction. The stability of the coast of Guyana, which is part of one of the world's most extensive mangrove coasts, depends on large mud banks migrating alongshore from the mouth of the Amazon River and on mangrove colonisation of these banks. Under the pressures of economic development, the coastal zone of Guyana is progressively being transformed into agricultural land and aquaculture estates, protected by coastal dikes. These hard coastal defence structures, constructed in recent years, are less effective in dissipating wave energy than mud banks. They also hinder the various processes involved in the consolidation and subsequent mangrove colonisation of these banks, notably by enclosing mature mangrove forests and preventing propagule transport from these forests to mud banks. If unchecked, the progressive breakdown in the mud-bank and associated mangrove system that has led to progradation of the coastal plain of Guyana over the last 5000 years will result in large-scale coastal erosion that can only be countered by further engineering structures at prohibitive costs. The only coastal defence strategy, sound and viable over the long term, with regards to both environmental conservation and cost, consists in restoring a dynamic mud-bank and mangrove system on this wave-exposed coast.",

      "abstract": "Mangroves are effective blue carbon sinks and are the most carbon rich ecosystems on earth. However, their areal extent has declined by over one-third in recent decades. Degraded mangrove forests result in reduced carbon captured and lead to release of stored carbon into the atmosphere by CO2 emission. The aim of this study was to assess changes in carbon dynamics in a gradually degrading mangrove forest on Bonaire, Dutch Caribbean. Remote sensing techniques were applied to estimate the distribution of intact and degraded mangroves. Forest structure, sediment carbon storage, sediment CO2 effluxes and dissolved organic and inorganic carbon in pore and surface waters across intact and degraded parts were assessed. On average intact mangroves showed 31% sediment organic carbon in the upper 30 cm compared to 20% in degraded mangrove areas. A loss of 1.51 MgCO2 ha−1 yr−1 for degraded sites was calculated. Water samples showed a hypersaline environment in the degraded mangrove area averaging 93 which may have caused mangrove dieback. Sediment CO2 efflux within degraded sites was lower than values from other studies where degradation was caused by clearing or cutting, giving new insights into carbon dynamics in slowly degrading mangrove systems. Results of water samples agreed with previous studies where inorganic carbon outwelled from mangroves might enhance ecosystem connectivity by potentially buffering ocean acidification locally. Wetlands will be impacted by a variety of stressors resulting from a changing climate. Results from this study could inform scientists and stakeholders on how combined stresses, such as climate change with salinity intrusion may impact mangrove's blue carbon sink potential and highlight the need of future comparative studies of intact versus degraded mangrove stands.",

      "abstract": "Rapidly changes in potential evapotranspiration can provide significant information in understanding of hydrologic processes as well as for agricultural crop performance. Such information can also prove to be useful in climate related studies. However, accurate measurements and predictions of evapotranspiration are difficult especially at large spatial scales. Remote sensing provides a cost‐effective approach to determine potential evapotranspiration at both regional and global scales. In the present study, effectiveness of Hamon’s method for measuring annual variations in potential evapotranspiration based using INSAT-3D dataset was evaluated for agricultural area of Varanasi region, India. Observed potential evapotranspiration data was compared with INSAT-3D satellite data. The performances indices such as correlation (r), Bias and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) indicate the values of 0.572, 0.524 and 0.834 for INSAT-3D data. Result indicated that INSAT-3D data further can be used for estimation of evapotranspiration.",

      "abstract": "Carnivorous plants (CPs)—those possessing specific strategies to attract, capture and kill animal prey and obtain nutrition through the absorption of their biomass—are harbingers of anthropogenic degradation and destruction of ecosystems. CPs exhibit highly specialised and often very sensitive ecologies, being generally restricted to nutrient-impoverished habitats where carnivory offers a competitive advantage. As such, they are often the first species to disappear following habitat degradation, land use change, and alteration to natural ecological processes, and are at significant risk from processes such as eutrophication and weed invasion, and even poorly-understood impacts such as airborne nitrogen inputs. Many of the world's 860 species of CPs are found in wetland habitats, which represent some of the most cleared and heavily degraded ecosystems on Earth. Global diversity hotspots for CPs are likewise located in some of the most heavily cleared and disturbed areas of the planet—southwestern Western Australia, Southeast Asia, Mediterranean Europe, central eastern Brazil, and the southeastern United States—placing their conservation at odds with human developmental interests. Many carnivorous plant species exhibit extreme range-restriction and are wholly localised to specific geological formations, microhabitats or elevations, with nowhere to move to in the face of environmental change, such as a warming, drying climate. We provide the first systematic examination of the conservation status and threats to all CPs globally, compiling full or partial assessments of conservation status category for 860 species from 18 genera, and provide ten recommendations towards better conservation and management of this iconic group. A total of 69 species were assessed as Critically Endangered (8% of all species), 47 as Endangered (6%), 104 as Vulnerable (12%), and 23 as Near Threatened (3%). Slightly over 60% of CPs (521 species) were assessed as Least Concern. At least 89 species are known from only a single location based on current knowledge. Data on threatening processes were available for 790 species, with the most common threatening processes including Agriculture and Aquaculture (impacting 170 species), Natural Systems Modifications (168 species), Climate Change and Severe Weather (158 species), Energy Production and Mining (127 species), Human Intrusions and Disturbance (126 species), and Biological Resource Use (98 species). Almost a quarter of all species were impacted upon by three or more threatening processes. The most significant threats placing species at imminent risk of extinction include the continuing clearing of natural habitat for urban and agricultural development and the illegal collection of individuals from the wild for horticultural trade. The complex and specialised ecological requirements of CPs, together with the multifaceted threats they face, make conservation difficult and repatriation even to restored areas challenging. As the number of vulnerable, endangered and extinct carnivorous plant species continues to grow, despite significant conservation efforts in many regions and greater awareness of their ecological requirements, it is clear that a paradigm shift is required in our approach to the preservation of this unique group of plants in order to achieve long-term conservation successes.",

      "abstract": "Carryover effects occur when an individual's experience during one stage of the annual cycle influences their behaviour in subsequent stages. This includes stages of the annual cycle, such as migration, when behaviour, such as departure timing, is also affected by circannual and circadian cues. In birds, the initiation of autumn migratory movements is often related to the timing of the cessation of the breeding season. However, less is known as to whether breeding season carryover effects also affect the pace of migration. To determine whether there are carryover effects from the breeding season to migration in barn swallows, Hirundo rustica, we monitored nests and used the Motus Wildlife Tracking System to determine migratory departure dates and the pace of migration. Barn swallows that finished breeding later in the summer initiated migration later and migrated faster through North America than swallows that finished breeding earlier in the summer. However, daily flight speeds were unrelated to the timing of the breeding season, suggesting that late-departing individuals increased their overall pace by reducing stopovers. Our results suggest that although barn swallows do not establish a nonbreeding territory, there are constraints during migration that require late-departing individuals to compensate for carryover effects from the breeding season. Late departure is not necessarily disadvantageous if individuals are able to ‘catch-up’ to early-departing individuals, but more work is needed to assess whether late departure and the faster pace of migration affect the subsequent survival of these individuals.",

      "abstract": "Noctilucent Clouds (NLC) and Mesospheric Summer Echoes (MSE) are ice-related phenomena that occur occasionally in the mid-latitude summer mesopause region and more frequently in the polar regions. We observe both phenomena above our site at Kühlungsborn (Germany, 54.1°N, 11.8°E) by lidar and radar since 1997 and 1998, respectively. The NLC season 2019 turned out to be record-breaking with respect to different parameters. We observed the brightest NLC (backscatter coefficient at 532 nm of βmax≈54⋅10−10m-1sr-1 ), the longest continuous NLC (~11 h) and the largest occurrence rates in June (~20%). The seasonally averaged NLC height was found 600 m lower in altitude in 2019 compared to our long-term record. Consistent with the NLC data, radar observations of MSE showed unusually long-lasting echoes and a higher occurrence rate in June 2019. In contrast to our initial expectations, this increase of ice abundance in 2019 was not related to a generally stronger advection from higher latitudes. Mean winds observed by a nearby meteor radar were essentially weaker than in previous years, even though the winds were still typically southward during NLC. Instead, we found unusually low mean temperatures below 83 km altitude (and down to 75 km) being the main reason for these extraordinary observations. Furthermore, water vapor concentrations were slightly enhanced in June 2019. Low temperatures and enhanced water vapor may be caused by stronger upwelling in the upper mesosphere. However, there is no vertical wind data available. Low solar activity was also a factor that promoted these good NLC conditions. Overall, we judge this a singular event and not as an indicator for climate change. Temperature data in the mesopause region and below are taken from Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) on NASA's Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics Dynamics (TIMED) satellite as well as Earth Observing System (EOS) Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) onboard NASA's Aura satellite.",

We present the first report on metallic elements in sea turtle eggs from the Indian Ocean.

The eggshells and egg contents of the loggerhead turtle, the smaller of the two species, had higher or significantly higher concentrations than leatherbacks, except for strontium - the reason is unknown. Elemental concentrations in eggshells and contents were the same or lower compared with other studies. The differences in concentrations in the egg contents and eggshells between the two species are likely due to different trophic levels, migration patterns, life histories, age, and growth, as well as differences in pollution sources and the uptake, retention and elimination characteristics of the different elements by the different species. We found no congruence between patterns in eggshells and corresponding egg contents, for both species. However, eggshells and egg contents showed congruence between species. The lack of congruence between eggshells and contents within each species precludes using eggshell concentrations as a proxy for egg content concentrations. Copper, strontium, and selenium occurred at concentrations higher than available toxic reverence values. Further research is warranted, including the analyses of POPs, as well as possible deme discrimination based on compositional pattern differences. Turtles serve as ‘active samplers’ returning to the same location to breed–something that is not practical with marine mammals or elasmobranchs.",

      "abstract": "The world's forests are being cleared at an alarming rate. While the Sustainable Development Goals established in 2015 aim to curb deforestation and poor forest management, the past five years have continued to see a dramatic decline in tree cover including in South American tropical forests which are characterized by high biodiversity and other ecosystem service (ES) values. Two tangible ES that are of direct and timely importance to water suppliers and regulators are water quality and water flow regulation—both of which are vital to a region's water security. This chapter provides an overview of the deforestation challenge in South American tropical forests and the water security benefits that are at risk. This chapter then discusses innovative tools that water suppliers and regulators—key stakeholders in water and forest management - can use to promote conservation and restoration, including an improved infrastructure investment decision-support tool called “Green-Gray Assessment,” multi-stakeholder partnerships, and financing mechanisms that can leverage existing capital.",

      "abstract": "This chapter is about synecology, or community ecology, and analyzes the dynamics of biological communities as a consequence of natural environmental changes, especially the climate changes described in Chapter 1. The main objective is to analyze how ecological communities have changed as a result of Quaternary climate variability and the resulting individual responses of species that compose them until reaching their current composition. The concept of community is discussed at first, in the framework of the different schools of ecological thinking, and the need for seeking empirical support in long-term ecological processes is highlighted. The discussion is focused on terms such as succession, community assembly, stability, resilience and domains of attraction. With this background, the ecological response of Quaternary ecosystems is analyzed with emphasis on novel Quaternary communities, the usefulness of chronosequences to reconstruct succession, recurrent community assembly and disassembly following the glacial-interglacial cycles, equilibrium or disequilibrium with climate, resilience and non-linear responses, and non-analog communities. It is concluded that deterministic hypothesis of community succession and assembly in equilibrium with climate are not supported by Quaternary evidence. Rather, community composition is constantly shifting under the effects of environmental change, in a permanent nonequilibrium dynamics resulting from idiosyncratic responses of species to climate shifts. A combination of niche features and random sampling from metacommunities, as proposed by the neutral theory o biodiversity, seems compatible with part of the available evidence.",

      "abstract": "The Dengue, Zika and Chikungunya viruses have been spreading in tropical regions, causing epidemics with high morbidity rates and fatal cases. The aim of this study was to assess the diversity and abundance of culicid species and the presence of arboviruses in mosquitoes, at the epicenter of an epidemic outbreak that occurred in people living near an urban Atlantic Forest park. Mosquitoes were captured with a Shannon trap between 2 and 6 pm in seven months of 2019. The Chikungunya virus was investigated according to the protocol described by Lanciotti (2007). The most abundant species were Wyeomyia bourrouli (66.9%) and Aedes albopictus (23.9%). Also captured were Aedes fluviatilis (3.2%); Haemagogus leucocelaenus (2.2%); Aedes scapularis (2.2%); Aedes aegypti (1.6%); Aedes serratus and (0.3%) and Aedes taeniorhynchus (0.3%). The Chikungunya virus was identified in A. aegypti females; A. albopictus females and males; Aedes fluviatilis and Wy.bourrouli. The presence of the Chikungunya virus in the afore mentioned mosquitoes reinforces the hypothesis that arbovirus expansion is associated with the participation of other mosquito species in the transmission areas, primarily the Chikungunya virus in the study area. The data also demonstrate the need for permanent entomological surveillance and measures to preserve the area, in order to hinder its degradation, the adaptation of culicid species to new habitats and the formation of enzootic cycles of these viruses in the forest.",

      "abstract": "High levels of CO2 emissions in the atmosphere and toxic pollutants in air, water and food have serious repercussions on all life's systems, including living beings, environment and economy. Everyone on the Earth is concerned by pollution in some way or another, no matter where and how the pollution is produced as airborne and foodborne pollutants could circulate around the world in different ways, through for example climate components (wind, rain) and/or import and export of foodstuffs. Similarly to living beings that take advantage of day-night circadian rhythms to recover after diurnal hardships, the environment in its entirety could also be seen as a complex living system that needs regular breaks to assimilate or ingest toxic pollutants produced during intensive and continuous industrial processes. If greenhouses gas emissions and pollution rates continue to increase at the same rates as they are nowadays, uncontrollable climate effects might be inevitable and the air quality in some crowded cities in the world might be hardly respirable in the future. A global “Clean Environmental Week” is discussed as an attempt toward reducing air pollution and CO2 emissions through the interruption or reduction of industrial polluting activities regularly, for a week or so per year, to let the nature ‘breathe’ and recover from environmentally challenging pollutions. A clean environmental period of 10 days per year could reduce CO2 emissions by about one billion tons of CO2 per annum.",

      "abstract": "Amazonia (sensu lato) is by far the largest tropical forest region, but has succumbed to the highest absolute rates of tropical deforestation and forest degradation, driven by rapid frontier expansion, road-building, and spontaneous or government-subsidized migration. The large area-through-time and paleo-climatic stability of Amazonian forests may help explain the high regional to local scale plant and animal species diversity of true forest specialists and high ecological sensitivity to contemporary land-use change. We describe the prevailing forms of anthropogenic disturbance that affect forest organisms in the context of the geographic and evolutionary background that has shaped the degree to which forest species may be resilient to environmental change. The fate of Amazonian biodiversity will partly depend upon the interaction between land-use and climate change, and the extent to which seasonally-dry forests can retain immunity against catastrophic recurrent wildfires. This review illustrates the importance of considering interactions between different forms of forest disturbance to develop effective conservation policy. We conclude with some considerations of the policy agenda necessary to protect forest cover and forest biodiversity at a meaningful scale across the Amazonian biome.",

      "abstract": "Kerteszia is a neotropical subgenus of Anopheles composed of 12 species. The species in this subgenus are strongly associated with humid forests rich in epiphytic bromeliads. Forest fragmentation and anthropogenic changes can therefore have a negative impact on the abundance and survival of these mosquito species. Within this subgenus, four species are considered primary vectors of malaria: An. cruzii, An. bellator, An. homunculus and An. neivai. Malaria cases associated with Kerteszia species are often referred to as bromeliad malaria, a type of malaria reported to be endemic in the coastal rainforest of the neotropical region since the end of the nineteenth century. Although the incidence of bromeliad-malaria cases has decreased since the middle of the last century, autochthonous malaria cases continue to be registered every year. The complexity of the epidemiology of bromeliad malaria appears to be increasing as asymptomatic plasmodial infections and transmission of simian Plasmodium to humans have recently been reported. Kerteszia vector species have a great affinity for human beings and can be found in human-modified areas close to forest fragments such as in the Extra-Amazonian region of Brazil, Colombian pacific coast, and the Caribbean coast. Deforestation and forest fragmentation have been occurring continuously in the biomes of the neotropical region, and findings of Kerteszia species in dwellings are frequent in this region. Controlling the species in the Kerteszia subgenus is particularly difficult because they move frequently from natural to rural and peri-urban areas in search of blood sources, posing a challenge for the development of control strategies based on integrated vector management. Furthermore, as it has been shown that some Kerteszia species share similar morphological and genetic characteristics, the existence of a species complex formed by cryptic, sibling species within the Kerteszia group in different areas in the South and Southeast of Brazil cannot be ruled out. The existence of such a complex could represent an obstacle to the control of Kerteszia species and consequently to the elimination of bromeliad-malaria transmission in these regions. Here, we review publications that focus on the biology and ecology of Kerteszia malaria vectors and their association with human-modified areas and bromeliad-malaria transmission.",

      "abstract": "The Amazon River is the largest river in the world in terms of freshwater discharge and sediment load. Understanding the fluvial sediment transport processes operating in the Amazon basin is critical because the Amazon basin has great research value for the sustainable development of local and global ecosystems. This study investigated changes in the mainstream sediment flux in the Amazon River system during 1996–2018. At the Óbidos gauge station (on the Amazon mainstream), sediment loading significantly increased during 1996–2007 (earlier half of the study period), but the trend then reversed and sediment loading decreased during 2007–2018 (later period). River runoff was relatively stable during 1996–2018. The monthly sediment load and sediment concentration at Óbidos were not synchronized with monthly runoff because of the asynchronism of the peak water discharges of the Solimões, Madeira, and Negro Rivers. We infer that the significant increase in sediment flux from the Solimões River was an important factor affecting the observed sediment increase at Óbidos during 1996–2007. Besides, the increasing wash-load sediment flux at Manacapuru (on the Amazon tributary) should be derived from the Middle and Lower Solimões River, because the sediment transport from the Upper Solimões River was decreasing. We also found that the reversal of the sediment load trend at Óbidos could be partly influenced by the decreasing trend of sediment transport from the Madeira River, and dam construction was one of the important causes. The reduced sediment loading in the Amazon mainstream will have major implications for the downstream ecosystem. Because planned dam constructions are expected to quadruple the number of dams in the Amazon basin, we suggest that the risk of wetland and muddy coast degradation caused by intensive hydropower development is an important pending issue.",

      "abstract": "Greenhouse gas emissions from the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) have received an increasing amount of attention in recent years because of concerns related to regional climate change and clean energy production. The present study compared the greenhouse gas emissions from the Modaoxi and Shennongxi rivers as the southern and northern tributaries of the TGR. Results indicated that mean annual fluxes of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) were 55.8950±92.9469mgm−2h−1 and 0.2544±0.9066mgm−2h−1 along the Shennongxi River and 77.0298±168.8724mgm−2h−1 and 0.2694±1.1006mgm−2h−1 along the Modaoxi River, respectively. While more CO2 was released along the Modaoxi River, the methane emissions were similar for these two tributaries. Multivariate analysis indicated that water quality variables were more closely correlated with CO2 emissions along the Shennongxi River than along the Modaoxi. Conversely, methane emissions were more closely correlated with water quality variables along the Modaoxi River than along the Shennongxi. Carbon emissions in these two tributaries were mainly affected by inorganic carbon in the water. Organic carbon in the water had almost no effect on carbon emissions in these two tributaries. Further analysis showed that eutrophication and algal blooms may generate the largest amounts of greenhouse gas emissions from the Shennongxi River basin, while farming and carbon input from the drawdown area may be the crucial factors affecting carbon emissions in the Modaoxi River basin.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to improve modeling of statistical properties of solar radiation models through the analysis of measurement data on the ground in the intertropical zone. For this, we identify, using information criteria, the probabilistic distributions introduced in two models of synthetic solar radiation generation. We then validate the results by using the KL divergence and KSI parameter as comparison criteria between the distributions arising from real and synthesized data. Our study confirms, for example, that the Gaussian classical distribution is not suitable for modeling solar radiation, and we propose other more suitable statistical laws instead. The value of the identification procedure of the distribution laws presented in this article is that it ensures the generation of solar radiation data comparable in their statistical content to the measured data. Another advantage is that this procedure contributes to highlighting the time invariance of distribution laws representing the random terms. We conclude that this new information-criteria-based method permits the identification of the probability laws that best describe the statistical distributions introduced in the models of synthetic solar radiation generation.",

      "abstract": "Tropical peatlands are a major, but understudied, biophysical feedback factor on the atmospheric greenhouse effect. The largest expanses of tropical peatlands are located in lowland areas of Southeast Asia and the Amazon basin. The Loreto Region of Amazonian Peru contains ~63,000 km2 of peatlands. However, little is known about the biogeochemistry of these peatlands, and in particular, the cycling of carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4), and their responses to hydrometeorological forcings. To address these knowledge gaps, we established an eddy covariance (EC) flux tower in a natural palm (Mauritia flexuosa L.f.) swamp peatland near Iquitos, Peru. Here, we report ecosystem-scale CO2 and CH4 flux observations for this Amazonian palm swamp peatland over a two-year period in relation to hydrometeorological forcings. Seasonal and short-term variations in hydrometeorological forcing had a strong effect on CO2 and CH4 fluxes. High air temperature and vapor pressure deficit (VPD) exerted an important limitation on photosynthesis during the dry season, while latent heat flux appeared to be insensitive to these climate drivers. Evidence from light-response analyses and flux partitioning support that photosynthetic activity was downregulated during dry conditions, while ecosystem respiration (RE) was either inhibited or enhanced depending on water table position. The cumulative net ecosystem CO2 exchange indicated that the peatland was a significant CO2 sink ranging from −465 (−279 to −651) g C m−2 y−1 in 2018 to −462 (−277 to −647) g C m−2 y−1 in 2019. The forest was a CH4 source of 22 (20 to 24) g C m−2 y−1, similar in magnitude to other tropical peatlands and larger than boreal and arctic peatlands. Thus, the annual carbon budget of this Amazonian palm swamp peatland appears to be a major carbon sink under current hydrometeorological conditions.",

      "abstract": "Tunas are highly specialized predators that have evolved numerous adaptations for a lifestyle that requires large amounts of energy consumption. Here we review our understanding of the bioenergetics and feeding dynamics of tunas on a global scale, with an emphasis on yellowfin, bigeye, skipjack, albacore, and Atlantic bluefin tunas. Food consumption balances bioenergetics expenditures for respiration, growth (including gonad production), specific dynamic action, egestion, and excretion. Tunas feed across the micronekton and some large zooplankton. Some tunas appear to time their life history to take advantage of ephemeral aggregations of crustacean, fish, and molluscan prey. Ontogenetic and spatial diet differences are substantial, and significant interdecadal changes in prey composition have been observed. Diet shifts from larger to smaller prey taxa highlight ecosystem-wide changes in prey availability and diversity and provide implications for changing bioenergetics requirements into the future. Where tunas overlap, we show evidence of niche separation between them; resources are divided largely by differences in diet percentages and size ranges of prey taxa. The lack of long-term data limits the ability to predict impacts of climate change on tuna feeding behaviour. We note the need for systematic collection of feeding data as part of routine monitoring of these species, and we highlight the advantages of using biochemical techniques for broad-scale analyses of trophic relations. We support the continued development of ecosystem models, which all too often lack the regional-specific trophic data needed to adequately investigate climate and fishing impacts.",

      "abstract": "Several studies addressed the water footprint (WF) of countries and virtual water (VW) trade in agricultural and industrial products, but freshwater use associated with wood products has received little attention. Yet, international trade in wood products has been growing, and forestry competes with other forest ecosystem services over limited freshwater resources. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to assess nations’ WFs of consumption of wood products, the sustainability of these WFs, and the VW flows associated with international trade in wood products. We account nations’ WFs of and VW trade in wood products with a Multi-regional Input-Output model (MRIO-forest) that tracks wood flows along global supply chains (production, processing, trade, and final uses) for the period 1997-2017 and assess the sustainability of the green and blue WF of wood products in 2017. The WF of wood production increased from 8.37 × 1011 m3/y in 1997 to 9.87 × 1011 m3/y in 2017. About 38% (3.76 × 1011 m3/y) of this WF relates to wood products for export (in 2017), which means that VW trade associated with wood products ranks in between agricultural and industrial products in absolute volumes. About 10% (9.9 × 1010 m³/y) of the green WF and 11% (3.4 × 109 m³/y) of the blue WF of wood products in 2017 are unsustainable, meaning that they are located in areas where the total green/blue WF exceeds the maximum sustainable green/blue WF. The unsustainable green WF occurs mainly in Germany, Indonesia, the Czech Republic and the UK, and mainly relates to coniferous sawnwood, paper and paperboard other than newsprint, fibreboard and non-coniferous sawnwood. The unsustainable blue WF, which is much smaller, occurs in the USA, Russia. Nigeria, Canada and India, and mainly relates to fuelwood, paper and paperboard other than newsprint, sawnwood and fibreboard. This study increases our understanding of how forest evaporation flows link to the final consumption of wood products and contributes to the wider debate on the allocation of freshwater resources in the global economy.",

      "abstract": "One of the largest environmental disasters worldwide occurred on November 5th, 2015, when the Fundão dam collapsed in Mariana (Minas Gerais State, Southeast Brazil). The tailing mud flooded the Doce River basin and reached the sea in the coast of Espírito Santo State (ES), Southeast Brazil. This coastal region is the habitat of the most isolated population of franciscana dolphins (Pontoporia blainvillei), with the lowest populational census and lowest genetic diversity in Franciscana Management Area Ia (FMA Ia) - 18° 25′S and 21° 17′S. This study aimed to assess the bioaccumulation of trace-elements (As, Cd, Cu, Fe, Hg, Mn, and Zn) in muscle, liver and kidney of franciscana dolphins collected near the Doce River's mouth before (n = 32) and after (n = 19) the tailing mud reached the sea. The Generalized Additive Model (GAM) showed increasing temporal trends of Hg and Zn in muscle and liver after the dam failure, probably related to higher concentrations and bioavailability in the water column and sediments from the Doce River. Declining trends were found for As and Cu muscular and hepatic concentrations and Fe concentrations in kidney due to their lower bioavailability after the disaster, caused by association with tailings mud trapped in the riverbanks and suspended particulate material. Additionally, higher As and Hg concentrations found in the first period of sampling may be due to historical contamination by mining activities. The full extent of the impacts caused by the Fundão dam failure is still unknown. However, due to their rapid increase and remobilization process, toxic effects can be induced in the biota by these elements. Elements' bioaccumulation in this study contributes to the knowledge of franciscana dolphins from FMA Ia. Considering the conservation concern regarding this franciscana population and its scarce knowledge, the impact of this disaster can be alarming for species conservation.",

      "abstract": "The question of the rampant erosion of the shorelines rimming the Mekong River delta has assumed increasing importance over the last few years. Among issues pertinent to this question is how it is related to mangroves. Using high-resolution satellite images, we compared the width of the mangrove belt fringing the shoreline in 2012 to shoreline change (advance, retreat) between 2003 and 2012 for 3687 cross-shore transects, spaced 100 m apart, and thus covering nearly 370 km of delta shoreline bearing mangroves. The results show no significant relationships. We infer from this that, once erosion sets in following sustained deficient mud supply to the coast, the rate of shoreline change is independent of the width of the mangrove belt. Numerous studies have shown that: (1) mangroves promote coastal accretion where fine-grained sediment supply is adequate, (2) a large and healthy belt of fringing mangroves can efficiently protect a shoreline by inducing more efficient dissipation of wave energy than a narrower fringe, and (3) mangrove removal contributes to the aggravation of ongoing shoreline erosion. We fully concur, but draw attention to the fact that mangroves cannot accomplish their land-building and coastal protection roles under conditions of a failing sediment supply and prevailing erosion. Ignoring these overarching conditions implies that high expectations from mangroves in protecting and/or stabilizing the Mekong delta shoreline, and eroding shorelines elsewhere, will meet with disappointment. Among these false expectations are: (1) a large and healthy mangrove fringe is sufficient to stabilize the (eroding) shoreline, (2) a reduction in the width of a large mangrove fringe to the benefit of other activities, such as shrimp-farming, is not deleterious to the shoreline position, and (3) the effects of human-induced reductions in sediment supply to the coast can be offset by a large belt of fringing mangroves.",

      "abstract": "Previous studies have proposed that the two-phase structure of Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1) is a ubiquitous feature. However, few studies have focused on the internal structure of HS1 over a tropical domain; thus, the interhemispheric ocean-atmosphere teleconnections during HS1 are poorly defined. Here, we present high-resolution sedimentological, geochemical, and palaeoceanographic records from the core CG2 in the southern South China Sea (SCS), off the northern Sunda Shelf. The core continuously spans 9.0–22.0 ky BP. The records suggest two episodes of increased monsoon rainfall during the pre-HS1 (∼19.0–18.0 ky BP) and in the early HS1 (17.5–16.1 ky BP), along with a weaker monsoon rainfall during the late HS1 (16.1–14.7 ky BP). In contrast, a lower precipitation over the Flores Sea occurred during the early HS1, off the southern Sunda Shelf, followed by an enhanced precipitation runoff during the late HS1 (Muller et al., 2012). Notably, these two different precipitation phases characterise a southward Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) shift over the Sunda Shelf during HS1. These changes are also consistent with other monsoon records, as well as other available data from the tropical to high latitudes of both hemispheres, supporting the global scope of the twofold HS1. We propose that the two episodes of intense monsoon rainfall over the northern Sunda Shelf during the pre-HS1 and the early HS1 observed in our study are closely linked to two different melting events associated with European ice sheet (EIS) retreat. We further propose that the subsequent maximum Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) reduction and the migration of the ITCZ to its southernmost position during the late HS1 are tightly connected with the destabilization of the marine-terminating ice-streams of the Laurentide ice sheet (LIS) in the North Atlantic. Tropical positive feedbacks during HS1, in turn, should have played an important role in sustaining the AMOC reduction and Northern Hemisphere (NH) stadial conditions, by continuously lowering the salinity of the low-latitude currents in the Atlantic Ocean. In addition, the tropical ITCZ appears to have been a key bridge in promoting interhemispheric climate connections, by which North Atlantic cooling was rapidly linked to increased Southern Ocean surface westerlies. This, in turn, drove upwelling and CO2 ventilation from the Southern Ocean, and thereby facilitated deglacial warming. Finally, these findings show that tropical climate variation is an important component of deglacial climate changes; understanding how it responds to millennial events like HS1 may help us better understand global teleconnections.",

      "abstract": "The Mekong river is one of the largest rivers in the world, which flows through six countries of Southeast Asia (China, Myanmar, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam). Its hydro-sedimentary regime is changing rapidly, as a consequence of a regional shift of land use (agriculture, road, etc.), damming, sand mining and climate changes, among others. This study assesses the behavior of particles transported in suspension in the Lower Mekong River (LMR), along approximately 1700 km from fluvial to estuarine environments. Suspended sediment properties were estimated, simultaneously with hydrodynamic conditions, during three field campaigns. In addition, further investigations were performed in the laboratory to assess the structures of particles (flocculated or not), their capacity to flocculate (and the impacts on siltation), under a wide range of sediment concentration (20–30,000 mg.L−1). This study confirms that suspended sediment transported in the LMR are predominantly (75% by volume) flocculi (or freshly eroded soils aggregates), with median aggregated particle size in the range 10–20 μm and median settling velocity of the order of 0.01–0.1 mm s−1. These flocculi are robust under the hydrodynamic conditions (turbulence and suspended sediment concentration – SSC) existing in the LMR. Laboratory investigations reveal the existence of a threshold sediment concentration (400 mg.L−1), beyond which flocculation and sedimentation increase of orders of magnitudes. Thus, concentration that exceeds this threshold might promote the formation of so-called fluid mud layers. Because of the nonlinear response of flocculation and sedimentation with SSC and considering the ongoing changes at a regional scale in the LMR, higher occurrence of fluid mud layers in the fluvial upstream waterbodies might be anticipated, and a lower occurrence in estuaries and alongshore where the concentration decrease. The geomorphology could be impacted, with an over-siltation in dams and an exacerbated erosion of the muddy-mangrove coast.",

      "abstract": "Mangrove forests are among the largest carbon (C) sinks in (sub) tropical areas, playing a vital role in reducing C emissions. However, these forests have degraded rapidly in recent decades due to various human activities and natural disturbances. Thus, mangrove restoration programs have been widely initiated to prevent further forest loss and to mitigate climate change. The measurement of ecosystem C storage in restored mangrove forests will provide crucial information for the temporal reporting of C emissions in reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) schemes. The question whether restored mangrove forests enhance sediment organic carbon (OC) and ecosystem C storage has not been resolved for mangrove restoration programs. The present study, therefore, aimed to quantify ecosystem C storage and the contribution of organic matter sources to sedimentary OC in Kandelia obovata forests aged 9, 19 and 27 years; Sonneratia caseolaris forests aged 2 and 3 years, and a reference mudflat forest aged 0 from Hau Loc, North-Central Vietnam. The mean above- and below-ground C stocks of these forests ranged from 12.7±2.4 to 107.5±10.7MgCha−1, and 103.8±2.9 to 412.4±6.5MgCha−1, respectively. The ecosystem C storage of mangrove forests tended to increase with stand age, ranging from 201.3±4.3 to 519.9±12.5MgCha−1, with an overall mean of 310.3±21.3MgCha−1. The contribution of mangrove litter to sedimentary OC was between 45.8±0.8 and 64.1±1.5% along a forest chronosequence. The increase of the OC content and ecosystem C storage, and the proportional contributions of OC sources with forest age resulted from higher biomass production following forest development and the location of stands in the intertidal zone. These findings highlighted the importance of mangrove restoration programs in enhancing the ecosystem C storage and the sediment OC.",

      "abstract": "The podzolic soils with characteristic eluvial horizon are widely distributed in the mountainous area of Taiwan with a cold and humid climate, where the altitude is greater than 3000 m above sea level. There are multiple sequence horizons along the soil profile in some of the places. These repeated patterns of the soil horizons have not been reported in the literature, which may indicate the cycles of climatic or environmental changes in the past. The puzzling origin of these soils may be answered by identifying the parent materials and their source areas through age dating and isotopic analyses. Four soil profiles were sampled from Hohuanshan (HHM and HWS), Nanhuashan (NH), and Battonguan (BTG) of the alpine area in central Taiwan. These soils, in general, show the characteristics of silt and silty loam in soil texture, high soil organic carbon, low cation exchange capacity, and low base saturation percentage. Soil classification in accordance with the US System (Soil Taxonomy) suggests all the soils in this study are Humicryepts. The index quantification from soil morphology also shows the extent of pedogenesis fairly between profiles, which is supported by the ages obtained from the charcoals or highly carbonized woods in various sizes found in the dark black soil horizons. It suggests that these soils began to develop approximately four thousand years ago, during the cool and dry period of the Holocene according to the paleoclimate records, and the cold and dry climate favors the preservation of charcoals. Despite the suspicions of aeolian deposits in Taiwan, the high mountain areas are far from the location of aeolian deposits. It was not until recent years that the researchers proposed the idea of aeolian addition to the soils in Hohuanshan. The characteristics of the multiple sequence soil horizons may offer an insight into the paleoenvironment of the high mountain areas. The bimodal pattern on the particle size distribution indicates an additional parental source for these soils. The evidence from the calculated strontium isotope ratios delivers an argument that these soils are developed by in-situ weathering with the addition of aeolian material. They are yellowish and subangular particles with sizes ranging from 7 to 10 µm. The aeolian deposits of Hohuanshan reveal the geochemical characteristics of the river sediments of the Da-An, Da-Chia, Da-Du River, and Cho-Shui Rivers. This suggests that the source of the aeolian particles in the soils was supplied with materials connected with the river system of central Taiwan. In the same manner, the aeolian deposits of Nanhuashan and Battonguan were likely derived from the river sediments of eastern Taiwan. The example from the NH profile indicates a constant rate of aeolian addition, which rules out the influence of the fluctuations of climate change since the mid-Holocene. The findings of this study not only help validate previous studies on the paleoenvironment of Taiwan but also inspire further aspects of the Taiwanese paleoclimate researches.",

      "abstract": "This study focuses on the dating of millimetric pisoliths from ferruginous duricrusts located in central Amazonia (Brazil), by coupling detailed mineralogy and two relevant dating methods: (i) (U-Th)/He analysis of goethites by mass spectrometry; (ii) analysis of radiation-induced defects of kaolinites embedded in duricrusts by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR). Three samples collected at different elevations in the landscape were selected. The goethite corrected ages range from 1.1–15.2 Ma and consistently increase with elevation. EPR was performed on kaolinites after several cycles of a deferration procedure. Considering extreme geochemical scenarii, the ages of kaolinites are 1.7–7.1 Ma for a closed system and 4.0–16.7 Ma for an open system with 100% Rn loss. Ages of goethites and kaolinites are close, in the limit of the uncertainty of the methods. They show important periods of duricrust formation at Middle Miocene and at Late Miocene/Pliocene. Data allow the estimation of lowering rates between 3 and 8 m/Ma, in agreement with independent data available in the literature for the central Amazonia region or even for erosion of other cratons in the world. The two dating methods can be compared on common duricrust samples. By revealing single or multi-step weathering/erosion episodes related to relictual paleosurfaces, they also bring promising contributions to an advanced knowledge of ancient and complex lateritic geosystems.",

      "abstract": "Two different mitigation scenarios for stabilising carbon dioxide concentration at 450ppmv by 2100 have been developed, based on the recently developed B1 baseline scenario (part of the IPCC Special Report on Emission Scenarios). In both mitigation scenarios, a global uniform carbon tax has been applied as a proxy of pressure on the system to induce a variety of mitigation measures — assuming the presence of some international mechanism for globally cost-efficient implementation of such measures. The two scenarios differ in the timing of mitigation action: early action versus delayed response. Analysis of the scenarios has led to the following findings. First, stabilisation at a carbon dioxide concentration of 450ppmv from the B1 baseline scenario is technically feasible. In the first quarter/second quarter of this century most of the reduction will come from energy-efficiency and fuel switching options; later on the introduction of carbon-free supply options will account for the bulk of the required reductions. Second, postponing measures foregoes the benefits of learning-by-doing, and, as a result, an early action strategy will at low discount rates lead to reduced mitigation costs compared to delayed response. The most difficult period for the mitigation scenarios is the 2010–2040 period (exact timing depends on early action or delayed response), when ‘bending the curve’ towards a lower carbon emission system will have to be initiated. Finally, while overall costs seems to be limited, there are large differences in costs and benefits for individual regions and sectors for instance in terms of redirection of investments, changing fuel trade patterns and changing energy expenditures.",

      "abstract": "The avifauna of Pantepui is an extraordinary assemblage characterized by high endemism, which likely originated through complex ecological and evolutionary processes. Here, we define this biogeographic province in terms of its unique avifauna, shared by a number of isolated mountains that distinguishes it from the surrounding lowlands, and comment on the geographical limits of the region. An endemism as high as 75% (considering both species and subspecies) characterizes the Pantepui avifauna, with most species widely distributed and few present in one or a few tepuis. We discuss the patterns of distribution and endemism of its avifauna and provide a biogeographic perspective on the processes that have potentially generated the current patterns of diversity and endemism. Though ecological factors likely influence current patterns of diversity, a signature of the historical process on the current composition and distribution of birds in the region is indicated by recent molecular studies. Finally, we discuss major lines of inquiry that may inspire future research endeavors and summarize the conservation issues that may be faced by the avifauna of the Pantepui.",

      "abstract": "Laguncularia racemosa (L.) Gaertn (Combretaceae) is one of the eight tree mangrove species of the Atlantic-Caribbean-Eastern Pacific region (AEP). This species is widely distributed throughout the Americas, Caribbean and the West Coast of Africa. Understanding genetic structure allows us to elucidate the main historical and contemporary mechanisms that influenced the distribution of natural populations. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the genetic diversity and genetic structure in populations of L. racemosa in the western Atlantic coast. Seven loci of nuclear microsatellites were used to genotype 102 individuals in eight populations. Laguncularia racemosa populations presented a hierarchical island model of genetic structure most likely resulting from propagule dispersal mediated by coastal superficial climatological circulation (Near-Surface Ocean Currents). Moreover, equatorial populations presented greater genetic variability than the tropical and subtropical populations, possibly related to the existence of refuges in the equatorial region during the last glacial period, followed by stepping-stone recolonization of tropical and subtropical mangroves in the Holocene.",

      "abstract": "Mangroves are globally important carbon stores and as such have potential for inclusion in future forest-based climate change mitigation strategies such as Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD+). Participation in REDD+will require developing countries to produce robust estimates of forest above-ground biomass (AGB) accompanied by an appropriate measure of uncertainty. Final estimates of AGB should account for known sources of uncertainty (measurement and predictive) particularly when estimating AGB at large spatial scales. In this study, mixed-effects models were used to account for variability in the allometric relationship of Kenyan mangroves due to species and site effects. A generic biomass equation for Kenyan mangroves was produced in addition to a set of species-site specific equations. The generic equation has potential for broad application as it can be used to predict the AGB of new trees where there is no pre-existing knowledge of the specific species-site allometric relationship: the most commonly encountered scenario in practical biomass studies. Predictions of AGB using the mixed-effects model showed good correspondence with the original observed values of AGB although displayed a poorer fit at higher AGB values, suggesting caution in extrapolation. A strong relationship was found between the observed and predicted values of AGB using an independent validation dataset from the Zambezi Delta, Mozambique (R2=0.96, p= <0.001). The simulation based approach to uncertainty propagation employed in the current study produced estimates of AGB at different spatial scales (tree – landscape level) accompanied by a realistic measure of the total uncertainty. Estimates of mangrove AGB in Kenya are presented at the plot, regional and landscape level accompanied by 95% prediction intervals. The 95% prediction intervals for landscape level estimates of total AGB stocks suggest that between 5.4 and 7.2 megatonnes of AGB is currently held in Kenyan mangrove forests.",

      "abstract": "Thanks to the recent development of integrative approaches that combine dated phylogenies with models of biogeographic evolution, it is becoming more feasible to assess the roles of dispersal and vicariance in creating complex patterns of geographical distribution. However, the historical biogeography of taxa with good dispersal abilities, like birds or flying insects, still remains largely unknown because of the lack of complete phylogenies accompanied by robust estimates of divergence times. In this study, we investigate the evolution and historical biogeography of the globally distributed pest genus Spodoptera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) using complete taxon sampling and an extensive set of analyses. Through the analysis of a combined morphological and molecular dataset, we provide the first robust phylogenetic framework for this widespread and economically important group of moths. Historical biogeography approaches indicate that dispersal events have been the driving force in the biogeographic history of the group. One of the most interesting findings of this study is the probable occurrence of two symmetric long-distance dispersal events between the Afrotropical and the Neotropical region, which appear to have occurred in the late Miocene. Even more remarkably, our dated phylogenies reveal that the diversification of the clade that includes specialist grass feeders has followed closely the expansion of grasslands in the Miocene, similar to the adaptive radiation of specialist grazing mammals during the same period.",

      "abstract": "Urban forests associated with green infrastructure for sustainable outcomes are particularly critical in the Global South, where some of the world’s fastest-growing cities are located. However, compared to temperate cities, the drivers of urban tree species distribution in tropical cities remain understudied. In this study, we quantify the spatial distribution and abundance of urban forests in the tropical city of Georgetown, Guyana. British colonialism has shaped this city, including forced movement of peoples under slavery from Africa and indentured servants from the Indian Subcontinent. We studied how this multicultural context has influenced tree species distributions in the capital city of the only Anglophone country in South America. We quantified the abundance of tree species using a stratified sampling design to distribute transects across fifteen neighborhoods that vary in distance to the colonial center of the city and ethnic composition. We recorded a total of 57 unique species, the majority of which (73%) were cultivated for their edible fruits. We identify tree species that likely represent Guyana’s unique multicultural heritage by comparing our species list to flora in nine cities in neighboring countries (Venezuela and Brazil) with different colonial histories. This international comparison identified a set of tree species that occurred only in Guyana. Relationships between ethnic composition and colonial history and tree species distribution were weak at the neighborhood scale, where proportion of East Indian residents had little explanatory power and distance to colonial center was correlated with abundance of only some species groups. This apparent discrepancy between neighborhood and national scales may relate to the establishment of Guyanese food as a unifying national identifier across ethnicities. The prominence of edible fruit trees in our study suggests a set of species that could be incorporated into urban planning to strengthen biocultural linkages, foster cultural integration, and promote food security.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this study was to derive the Surface Suspended Sediment Concentration (SSSC) and river sediment discharge (for the period 2000-2016) along the Orinoco River reaches using MODIS remote sensing data. A single SSC retrieval algorithm was calibrated using HYBAM long term monitoring program data (n = 183). The comparison of satellite and field measurements showed a RMSE of 32%, corresponding to a mean absolute error of 21 mg l−1. These results supported the use of MODIS sensors to monitor the SSSC at six virtual stations in the middle and lower reaches of the Orinoco River. The highest mean SSSC were found downstream of the Meta River (101 mg l−1) and of the Apure River (99 mg l−1), which provide the major sediment input to the Orinoco main stream. The lowest mean SSSC was found upstream of the Meta River (42 mg l−1). In the lower reach, at Ciudad Bolivar station we assessed a mean SSSC of 88 mg l−1. MODIS-derived and ground-derived assessments of the annual sediment discharge show very fine agreement, within −2%. Coupling satellite-derived SSSC estimates and river discharge monitoring data, we calculated the Orinoco River sediment discharge at Ciudad Bolivar station between 2001 and 2016. For a mean Orinoco River discharge of 33,320 m3.s−1, the sediment loads varied from 75 to 103 Mt.yr−1, with a mean value of 89 Mt.yr−1 (RSD of 9%) corresponding to a sediment yield of 91–125 t.km−2yr−1 with no positive or negative trends over the observed period.",

      "abstract": "The old paradigm that Amazonia's tropical ecosystems prevented cultural development beyond small-scale shifting agricultural economies, that had little environmental impact, no longer holds true for much of Amazonia. A diversity of archaeological evidence, including terra preta soils, raised fields, causeways, large habitation mounds, geometric earthworks, and megalithic monuments, all point to considerable cultural complexity and environmental impacts. However, uncertainty remains over the chronology of these cultures, their diet and economy, and the scale of environmental impact and land use associated with them. Here, we argue that a cross-disciplinary approach, closely coupling palaeoecology and archaeology, can potentially resolve these uncertainties. We show how, with careful site selection (pairing small and large lakes, close proximity to archaeological sites, transects of soil pits) and choice of techniques (e.g., pollen, phytoliths, starch grains, charcoal, stable isotopes), these two disciplines can be successfully integrated to provide a powerful tool for investigating the relationship between pre-Columbian cultures and their environment.",

The seasonality and distribution of the Amazon River Plume (ARP), as well as the volume transport of the North Brazil Current (NBC) in two cross-current sections were described. The results indicate the NBC influences on the shape and spread of the ARP, and the relationship between the seasonal behavior of the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone migration, of the wind stress curl, and of the northern branch of the South Equatorial Current with the NBC pattern.",

      "abstract": "This chapter analyzes to what extent it is possible to speak of a Latin American electricity transition, given the intraregional and inner-country differences in terms of availability of renewable energy sources, intended nationally determined contributions, and existent electricity matrixes. The subcontinent has not managed to diversify away from fossil fuels and climate-sensitive hydropower, in order to guarantee an environmental-friendly energy security. The Latin American countries find themselves in different stages of market developments, have scattered and diverse renewable energy sources, and seek different electricity transitions within different time frames. This chapter shows that Latin American countries still have a lot to grow in terms of grid interconnection and energy exchange, developments of which might build common ground for a Latin American electricity transition. In the pursue of economic development fueled by renewable energy sources, the region needs to avoid the “transition-related renewables curse,” being paramount to analyze from which diversification stakeholders are talking about, so the maintenance and growth of the renewables’ share in the electricity matrixes of countries are not hampered.",

      "abstract": "Offsetting carbon (C) emissions and reducing nitrogen (N) pollution have been goals of mangrove restoration programs around the world. There is a common, yet dubious expectation that mangrove restoration will result in immediate and perpetual delivery of ecosystem services. There are expected time lags between mangrove clearing and C and N losses, and between restoration and C and N gains. Obtaining accurate rates of losses and gains requires frequent and long-term sampling, which is expensive and time consuming. To address this knowledge gap, we used a chronosequence of mangrove forests in mangroves in Matang Mangrove Forest Reserve (MMFR) in Malaysia, a region with one of the most C dense forests in the world. In this site, we assessed the ecosystem C and N stocks, including soil, downed wood, downed litter, and trees. The objective was to measure C and N changes through time. After mangrove clearing, C and N losses in soil and downed wood were rapid, with stocks halved after just one year. In the first 10 years after replantation, the forest recovered quickly, with rates of C accumulation of 9.5 Mg C ha−1 yr−1. After ten years, the rate of accumulation decreased to 2.8 Mg C ha−1 yr−1. However, 40 years after replantation, mangroves were still about 26% lower in C and 15% lower in N compared to our reference forest. The trajectory of recovery of C and N stocks in these forests was different among mangrove components: forest litter recovered rapidly, but downed wood and soil recovered much slower. Programs aimed at reducing C emissions and N pollution should consider that there are temporal lags and ecosystem trade-offs when assessing the effectiveness of mangrove protection and restoration as climate change mitigation strategies.",

This study showed an endangered wild howler species (Alouatta belzebul) parasitized by Pediculus mjobergi. Twenty-seven primates were rescued during wildlife rescue activities in the process of vegetation suppression at the Belo Monte Hydroelectric Power Plant (UHE), located on the lower Xingu River, in the Brazilian Amazon basin. Among the 27 primates examined from two vegetal formations (alluvial rainforest and liana-infested forest) areas, 13 (48.15%) were parasitized by lice with all positive primates being from alluvial rainforest. Optical and scanning electron microscopy allowed the visualization of the structures and the diagnostic characters of the lice species in greater detail expanding the current description. These results highlight the importance of considering ecological and regional features to provide a better understanding of the factors that promote parasitism.",

      "abstract": "The global environmental problems and the demographic problem, which are the focus of the geoenvironmental engineering practice, and the actions toward restoration of the environment are the subjects of this chapter. In seeking solutions to restore the degradation of the environment, we need to consider the interconnecting nature of the various ecosystems and be aware of the developments in various allied disciplines and how these may impact on developing and implementing sound engineering solutions to various environmental problems. The impact of the exploitation and utilization of the natural systems by nations on the depletion of natural resources; elimination of species; flora and fauna local and regional changes; and deterioration of the environment through solid and liquid waste, air and water pollution, and by greenhouse gases is summarized with case studies from around the world. It is also highlighted that the impacts upon the natural systems vary geographically, depending on the existing states of both the natural environment and the economy, but in many cases these impacts extend to a regional or even a global scale. This chapter also discusses evidences of global environmental impacts such as: (a) pollution of air, land, and water, due to accidents during the transportation of oil or other products by ship, plastic debris in the rivers and oceans, effluent discharge into fresh water bodies; (b) water scarcity and degradation; (c) growing quantities of wastes as a result of chemical product utilizations in all human activities, from agriculture to medicine, to energy and industrial and manufacturing processes, to everyday products; (d) trans-boundary movement of hazardous waste; (e) acid rain; (f) deforestation and land degradation; (g) desertification and soil erosion; (h) depletion of the ozone layer; and (i) the decreasing species of wildlife. The greatest emphasis is given here to global warming and climate change, where, according to all scientific evidence the question no longer is if, but how abruptly a global climate change will happen. Several examples are provided of the most recent information on glaciers and ice sheets melting, extremes in the hydrologic cycle, rise in sea temperature and level, and flora and fauna changes as result of the global warming. This chapter also provides references and excerpts from important national and international conventions and legislation regarding the topics addressed. We further discuss the interconnections between global environmental problems and highlight the importance of the following:1.Current processes are characterized by a nonlinear behavior and we lack the scientific understanding to predict what alterations in one would entail for another process. This means that we do not know the tipping point, which when reached changes can become unpredictable and the magnitude and impact of events may not be of the same order of what was experienced in the past.2.If the present generation does not come up with adequate protective measures and solutions, and the environment continues to deteriorate on a global scale, many unpredictable events of large scale can eventually be faced by the next generation altering drastically its living conditions. Therefore it is urgent to comprehensively step up conservation efforts of the global environment, with a far-reaching long-term perspective that transcends the generations.3.Development of solutions to restore the degradation of the environment is complicated by the interconnecting nature of the various ecosystems, i.e., atmosphere, hydrosphere, geosphere, and biosphere that constitute the land. This means that a cooperative and holistic global effort should be considered in developing a viable solution to global environmental problems.4.Global environmental issues interlock in forming a group of issues which, with the joint cooperation of the international community, need to be comprehensively addressed under a broad and long-term perspective. It is important that all nations take up conservation of the global environment as an important policy task and take initiatives in realizing sustainable development on a global scale. All of the above pose great challenges to modern geoenvironmental engineers as they need to expand significantly their traditional knowledge base and professional role to consider as integral part of their activities an assessment of projects' impact on ecosystems, air, water, and land, and in many cases, consider this beyond a limited, local level. We hope that this chapter aids in this goal of promoting a new definition of geoenvironmental engineering that is urgently needed to address current needs.",

      "abstract": "Histoplasma is an endemic fungus prevalent throughout the Mississippi, Ohio, and St. Lawrence River valleys as well as parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, Africa and Asia. Disease due to Histoplasma is termed histoplasmosis. The fungus is thermally dimorphic as it typically exists as a mold in the environment, which transitions to a yeast form during histoplasmosis in warm-blooded animals. Among the endemic dimorphic MYCO-Sses, histoplasmosis is one of the most frequently clinically encountered. Significantly, those in endemic areas are at extremely high risk for acquiring the fungus, but clinical disease remains uncommon. Nevertheless, there are ~1500 hospitalizations per year in the USA. Severity of disease is correlated with the infectious inoculum, with high dose acquisition leading to more frequent disease. Disease severity is also linked to the virulence of individual strains as well as the immunological state of the acutely or latently infected individual, with serious disease being more common in individuals with advanced HIV infection or on drugs that suppress immune functions, such as inhibitors of tumor necrosis factor-α. Moreover, reactivation of latent infection is a major risk in immunosuppressed individuals. Gold-standard techniques for histoplasmosis diagnosis include direct visualization of the fungus or culture isolation from clinical samples. Immunodiagnostic techniques, including immunodiffusion, complement fixation, and new lateral flow tests, assist with the presumptive diagnosis. Treatment depends on the severity of disease, with itraconazole being used in moderate and amphotericin B in more serious manifestations of histoplasmosis. Histoplasmosis remains an understudied and neglected pathogen that merits ongoing study to more fully understand the pathobiology of the fungus, to develop sensitive, rapid and specific diagnostics and more effective therapeutic strategies.",

      "abstract": "The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) encourage nations to substantially increase food production to achieve zero hunger (SDG 2) while preserving life on land (SDG 15). A key question is how to reconcile these potentially competing goals spatially. We use integer linear programming to develop an ‘integrated land use planning framework’ that identifies the optimal allocation of 17 crops under different hypothetical conservation targets while meeting agricultural demands by 2030. Intensifying existing cropland to maximum yield before allocating new cropland would reduce land requirement by 43% versus cropland expansion without intensification. Even with yield gap closure, tropical and sub-tropical crops still require expansion, primarily allocated to Venezuela, eastern Brazil, Congo Basin, Myanmar and Indonesia. Enforcement of protected areas, via avoiding conversion in 75% of Key Biodiversity Areas and 65% of intact areas, is vital to attain biodiversity targets but bears large opportunity costs, with agricultural rents dropping from $4.1 to $2.8 trillion. Although nationally constrained forest conservation efforts would earn 9% less agricultural rents compared to globally coordinated conservation solutions, they were also able to reduce intact habitat and forest loss (43% and 35% reduction). Our results demonstrate that careful choice of the allocation of future cropland expansion, could dramatically reduce—but not eliminate—the tradeoffs between the SDGs for food production and land biodiversity conservation.",

      "abstract": "South America houses a significant proportion of the world's plant diversity and therefore merits conservation attention. However, ongoing habitat fragmentation, degradation and destruction of natural habitats threaten biodiversity. A set of seven threats to natural ecosystems derived from a previous study (Jarvis et al. 2010), combined with a dataset of occurrences from 16,339 species, and also with the World Database of Protected Areas were used to analyse the patterns of threats to flora in South America and its conservation. Species richness per ∼50km side cell ranged from 1 to 2149 taxa, but with most of the areas presenting between 1 and 58 taxa. Population accessibility, expansion of agriculture and grazing pressure were found to be the key drivers of immediate extinction risk. A considerable (78.4%) number of species presented at least one population under high threat due to the expansion and intensification of these anthropogenic activities. In addition, some 13.8% of the analysed species presented up to 80% of their populations at risk of extinction (high threat index). On the conservation side, 82.3% of the analysed taxa have at least one population occurring within a protected site. However, it is important to note that for a protected area system to be effective and efficient, the conservation of within-taxon genetic diversity is required. The expansion, monitoring and strengthening of 24 existing protected areas holding up to 70% of South American plant diversity is suggested; as is the revision of seven additional sites where up to 200 species not currently conserved are present. Critical areas to monitor, expand and strengthen are mainly located in the Ecuadorian and Colombian Andes, southern Paraguay, the Guyana shield, southern Brazil, and Bolivia.",

      "abstract": "Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries (REDD+), is still a promising mechanism of the UNFCCC for many tropical countries that would like to receive a fair financial compensation for their historical and current efforts to avoid forest conversion at the expense of more economically land uses. Brazil has a great opportunity to successfully participate in REDD+ not only because of its huge Amazon forest area (ca. 4 million km2) but also because of its advanced forest monitoring system “PRODES”. However, this opportunity could be threatened due to the current differentiated monitoring capacities of most Brazilian Amazon states, markedly in High-Forest and Low-Deforestation (HFLD) regions. This is evident in the State of Amapá, which despite its political will to support actions towards the design of its REDD+ strategy, is still struggling with key technical aspects of forest monitoring. To address this issue and to strengthen the on-going REDD+ design process we assessed a) land use and land cover (LULC) changes for period of 23 years (1985–2008); b) estimated CO2 emissions associated to these LULC changes; c) identified the main drivers and agents of deforestation, and d) discussed policy implications for REDD+ implementation in a HFLD area. We applied a methodology, which is capable of reducing cloud cover using temporal filters on the classified images, detecting deforestation (and forest degradation) in areas as small as 1 ha, and used the decision tree method to identify different LULC types. This methodology was able to demonstrate that forest cover in northern Amapá has remained almost untouched during the observed period of 23-years. As many other HFLD areas, this region has a great potential to receive financial benefits from the REDD+ mechanism, especially from voluntary markets that are largely interested in the conservation value of these areas. However, the use of high accuracy LULC classification approaches, with appropriate Measuring, Reporting and Verification systems should be part of the REDD+ implementation strategy of HFLD areas towards having high standards for certified carbon, and therefore improved chances to receive better prices for carbon offsets. The potential of REDD+ to be a fair and efficient mechanism will also depend on the recognition of the historical efforts to avoid deforestation in HFLD areas, mainly by Federal Governments, as an incentive for low-carbon development.",

      "abstract": "To obtain a better insight into past vegetational, and climatic changes along the Pole-Equator- Pole: Americas transect, 32 late Quaternary pollen records from savanna, forest-savanna transition regions of the South American neotropics, and north and south of the equator, have been compared in this chapter. During pre-full glacial times, environmental changes in savannas were spatially complex. Some records show either stable grassland, where forest exists today, or a repeated alternation between forest, and savanna. During the full glacial period, neotropical savannas, both north and south of the equator, expanded because of markedly drier conditions. In the southern neotropical regions, savanna area was reduced, and replaced by subtropical grassland by cold climatic conditions during glacial periods. During the late glacial period, climate changed to wetter conditions north of equator earlier at 16,000-14,000 14C B.P., in montane regions. Wetter conditions were not recorded in the high plains or lowlands. During the early Holocene, the climate was drier in most of the South American savannas. Early Holocene distribution of savanna was much larger than during the late Holocene. The general synchrony of paleoenvironmental changes since the full glacial period, from neotropical savanna sites north and south of the equator, suggests changes in the latitudinal migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) may have played an important role. The movement of the high pressure cell over the South Atlantic, and changes in frequency of the tracks of the Antarctic cold fronts were also important.",

      "abstract": "Long pollen records from two sediment cores of the basin of Bogotá (Colombia) are presented, reflecting the dynamic history of environmental and vegetation changes in the tropical high Andes during the Quaternary. An astronomically tuned age model has been developed by using the visual correlation of the temperature-constrained record of Alnus with the benthic δ18O stacked record of ODP Site 846 and 849 for the last 1 million year (Ma). In addition, spectral analysis of the arboreal pollen percentages (AP%) prior to 1 Ma shows two consistent peaks at 7.6 and 9.5 m, which could either be interpreted as reflecting the 19 and 23-kyr components of the precession cycle or the 41-kyr cycle of obliquity. Evidence for precession forcing comes from the sum of the filtered 7.6 and 9.5 m cycles, revealing a long-term modulation that can be linked to the short-term (100-kyr) and long-term (400-kyr) eccentricity cycles. A precession-forced scenario, however, is not consistent with zircon fission-track ages and is difficult to explain in terms of climate forcing mechanisms. On the contrary, an obliquity control of the AP% record is consistent with the fission-track ages and with glacial–interglacial-bound temperature changes within the study region. Accordingly, it appears that the Funza09 record extends back to ∼2.25 Ma during which four periods with distinct different depositional environments could be identified, following a chronological poorly constrained interval of fluvial and fluvio-lacustrine sediments. From ∼2.25 to ∼1.47 Ma sediment deposition occurred in an area of wetlands dissected by fluvial channels and swamps. The strongest subsidence of the basin occurred between ∼1.47 and ∼1.23 Ma when a proper lake developed. Lacustrine sediments accumulated in water up to 50 m deep between ∼1.23 and ∼0.86 Ma. Hereafter, water depth was generally lower than 50 m, but fluctuated in conjunction with the 100-kyr dominated glacial–interglacial variability during the middle and late Pleistocene. The evolutionary changes of the páramo and montane forest biomes are described in terms of five characteristic stages. Most of the Pleistocene vegetation has no analogue to modern assemblages principally due to the late immigration events of Alnus (1.01 Ma) and Quercus (0.43 Ma) and we conclude that forest composition similar to modern was not established until the Last Interglacial. However, modern ecological constraints of suites of taxa that formed the vegetation of the pre-MIS 5 part of the record allow a reconstruction of environmental and climate change.",

      "abstract": "Bark Beetles: Abstract Mountain pine beetles (MPBs), tiny weevil-like insects, have laid waste to millions of acres of pine forests in western North America. In this case study, we explore why this native pest has had such catastrophic impacts in recent years, the environmental factors that influence the outbreak, and the future system-wide impacts of this infestation. Students will have the opportunity to quantify the economic impact of infestation, explore and evaluate the literature regarding the indirect effects of MPBs on forest ecosystems and on climate change, use geospatial tools available from the US Forest Service (USFS) to evaluate forest susceptibility and the extent of forest pest outbreaks, and design an experiment to better understand how pine trees respond to MPB invasions. Alberta’s Tar Sands: Abstract The extraction and processing of the vast underground deposits of tar sands in Canada's Alberta Province are having a variety of environmental consequences. We begin this case study with an overview of how tar sands are converted into petroleum products like gasoline, explore some of the many environmental and human health effects linked to the tar sands operation, and evaluate the net energy gain for tar sands oil compared to other sources, with an added focus on CO2 emissions. Students will have the opportunity to complete some \"back-of-the-envelope\" calculations about global oil production and the potential contribution of tar sands oil to global CO2 emissions, evaluate research on the effects of tar sands operations on regional air and water quality and human health, examine the externalities associated with tar sands oil production, and consider the big picture, including the environmental justice implications and steps being taken to reduce the impacts associated with tar sands operations. Desertification: Abstract Poorly understood by many, desertification of normally dry but usable lands threatens the existence of some of the world's most vulnerable populations in Africa and Central Asia. This case study examines the causes and extent of desertification, considers the social and environmental consequences of desertification, reviews several studies that investigate the progression and impacts of desertification, and explores a variety of efforts around the globe to slow or reverse the process. Students will have the opportunity to use remote sensing imagery to evaluate desertification trends over time, critique research articles on desertification causes and impacts, design an experiment to better understand spatial variability in desertification, evaluate carbon emissions from areas undergoing desertification, and propose a program to help control desertification. Amazon Rain Forest: Abstract The Amazon Basin's tropical rainforest, home to a dazzling array of plants and animals and an important player in global climate change, is threatened by a variety of stressors. We start this case study with a review of the rainforest ecosystem and the various activities that threaten its future; examine the complex relationship among the rainforest ecosystem, climate change, and fires in the Amazon Basin; and consider ongoing attempts and future strategies for minimizing damage to the rainforest. Students will have the opportunity to conduct “back-of-the-envelope” calculations to assess the extent of deforestation, explore the impacts of agriculture and mining activities on the rainforest, employ satellite data to estimate the extent of fires, investigate management and policy approaches designed to minimize deforestation, and consider environmental justice issues resulting from logging in the Amazon. E-Waste: Abstract The explosive growth in the use of computers, cell phones, and other technological devices has led to a surplus of hazardous “techno-trash” around the globe. In this case study, we identify what electronic waste (e-waste) is and how much is being generated; introduce the concepts of life cycle assessment (LCA), carbon footprints, and ecological footprints as a way to investigate the cumulative environmental impacts of our high-tech products; examine the fate and impact of e-waste; and consider some steps that can be taken to minimize our e-waste problem. Students will have the opportunity to calculate the value of precious metals contained in the technological devices and explore the political aspects of rare earth element reserves, determine the carbon footprint of cell phones and estimate their own personal ecological footprints, conduct a LCA of cell phones, investigate the myriad environmental and human health effects and the environmental justice aspects of e-waste recycling programs, and propose an e-waste management program for their own school or community. GMOs: Abstract Genetically modified crops like corn, soy, cotton, and canola oil are now common in many parts of the globe, yet their use remains controversial. In this case study, we define genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and give an overview of their history, discuss the current uses of GMOs, and describe the pros and cons of their use. Students will have the opportunity to examine the connections between GMO use and declines of monarch butterfly populations, design an experiment to determine the environmental impacts of a GMO crop of their choice, write a position paper and defend their choice regarding the use of GMO crops, and investigate the ethical issues surrounding GMO use.",

      "abstract": "The long term effect of Reduced-Impact Logging (RIL) on above-ground live biomass (AGB) dynamics was investigated in 18 1-ha logged over permanent sample plots set up in a terra firme rain forest in the Eastern Amazon (Brazil, Paragominas). Both tree survival and growth were investigated among three Diameter at Breath Height (DBH) classes (20–40, 40–60, ⩾60cm) to assess the contribution of each DBH class to the post-logging AGB recovery. Before logging, mean tree density and AGB per plot (dbh⩾20cm) were 187±14 trees ha−1 and 377.6±62.8Mgha−1 respectively. Although big trees (dbh⩾60cm) only represented 9.3% of the total tree density, they gathered almost half of total AGB. During the post-logging period (8years), the mortality of large trees was found to drive the annual net changes and largely overcame the AGB gain in the smaller DBH classes. Indeed, plots with high post-logging mortality of large trees showed negative carbon balance t over the study period (8years). The over mortality of large trees injured by logging contributed significantly to the annual AGB losses (up to 40%) in the first years after logging. Due to the overwhelming importance of this size class in carbon stocks and dynamic, reducing logging damages and intensity might have great impact in the post-logging biomass dynamics. We estimated that reducing logging intensity from 6 to 3 stems ha−1 would save 27.7Mg C ha−1 for a 35years rotation cycle. To compensate this loss of profits, compensatory payments of avoided CO2 emission should worth US $ 6.5/Mg of CO2. This price falls into the range of prices of the international carbon market. Sustainable forest management aiming at enhancing carbon stocks could therefore promote the preservation of the large trees. At our study site, we recommend the adoption of a maximum diameter cutting limit of 110cm.",

      "abstract": "Dengue fever (DENF), chikungunya (CHIK), and Zika are responsible for the majority of the burden caused by vector-borne diseases (VBDs); which are produced by viruses primarily transmitted by the Aedes mosquito. Aedes have become prolific in urban areas due to a combination of climate change, rapid urbanization, increased human mobility, and globalization, causing the three VBDs to emerge in novel regions. Community knowledge can provide detailed insights about the spatial heterogeneity of disease risk and rates within a particular region, improving public health interventions. Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) surveys are used to shed light on at-risk communities’ understanding of the vector, the pathogen, prevention and treatment strategies. Little is known how KAP varies among diseases, and among neighborhoods within a city. Understanding KAP variation among co-circulating VBDs at a fine-level, especially differences between endemic and emerging diseases, can improve targeted interventions, education programs, and health policy. We administered KAP surveys to 327 individuals in healthcare centers and selected neighborhoods in Cali, Colombia in June 2019. We utilized generalized linear models (GLMs) to identify significant predictors of KAP. Our findings suggest that knowledge is related to community characteristics (e.g. strata), while attitudes and practices are more related to individual-level factors. Access to healthcare also forms significant predictor of residents participating in preventative practices. The results can be leveraged to inform public health officials and communities to motivate at-risk neighborhoods to take an active role in vector surveillance and control, while improving educational and surveillance resources in Cali, Colombia.",

      "abstract": "Coastal and estuarine landforms provide a physical template that not only accommodates diverse ecosystem functions and human activities, but also mediates flood and erosion risks that are expected to increase with climate change. In this paper, we explore some of the issues associated with the conceptualisation and modelling of coastal morphological change at time and space scales relevant to managers and policy makers. Firstly, we revisit the question of how to define the most appropriate scales at which to seek quantitative predictions of landform change within an age defined by human interference with natural sediment systems and by the prospect of significant changes in climate and ocean forcing. Secondly, we consider the theoretical bases and conceptual frameworks for determining which processes are most important at a given scale of interest and the related problem of how to translate this understanding into models that are computationally feasible, retain a sound physical basis and demonstrate useful predictive skill. In particular, we explore the limitations of a primary scale approach and the extent to which these can be resolved with reference to the concept of the coastal tract and application of systems theory. Thirdly, we consider the importance of different styles of landform change and the need to resolve not only incremental evolution of morphology but also changes in the qualitative dynamics of a system and/or its gross morphological configuration. The extreme complexity and spatially distributed nature of landform systems means that quantitative prediction of future changes must necessarily be approached through mechanistic modelling of some form or another. Geomorphology has increasingly embraced so-called ‘reduced complexity’ models as a means of moving from an essentially reductionist focus on the mechanics of sediment transport towards a more synthesist view of landform evolution. However, there is little consensus on exactly what constitutes a reduced complexity model and the term itself is both misleading and, arguably, unhelpful. Accordingly, we synthesise a set of requirements for what might be termed ‘appropriate complexity modelling’ of quantitative coastal morphological change at scales commensurate with contemporary management and policy-making requirements: 1) The system being studied must be bounded with reference to the time and space scales at which behaviours of interest emerge and/or scientific or management problems arise; 2) model complexity and comprehensiveness must be appropriate to the problem at hand; 3) modellers should seek a priori insights into what kind of behaviours are likely to be evident at the scale of interest and the extent to which the behavioural validity of a model may be constrained by its underlying assumptions and its comprehensiveness; 4) informed by qualitative insights into likely dynamic behaviour, models should then be formulated with a view to resolving critical state changes; and 5) meso-scale modelling of coastal morphological change should reflect critically on the role of modelling and its relation to the observable world.",

      "abstract": "The squirrel monkey, Saimiri, is a pan-Amazonian Pleistocene radiation. We use statistical phylogeographic methods to create a mitochondrial DNA-based timetree for 118 squirrel monkey samples across 68 localities spanning all Amazonian centers of endemism, with the aim of better understanding (1) the effects of rivers as barriers to dispersal and distribution; (2) the area of origin for modern Saimiri; (3) whether ancestral Saimiri was a lowland lake-affiliated or an upland forest taxa; and (4) the effects of Pleistocene climate fluctuation on speciation. We also use our topology to help resolve current controversies in Saimiri taxonomy and species relationships. The Rondônia and Inambari centers in the southern Amazon were recovered as the most likely areas of origin for Saimiri. The Amazon River proved a strong barrier to dispersal, and squirrel monkey expansion and diversification was rapid, with all speciation events estimated to occur between 1.4 and 0.6Ma, predating the last three glacial maxima and eliminating climate extremes as the main driver of squirrel monkey speciation. Saimiri expansion was concentrated first in central and western Amazonia, which according to the “Young Amazon” hypothesis was just becoming available as floodplain habitat with the draining of the Amazon Lake. Squirrel monkeys also expanded and diversified east, both north and south of the Amazon, coincident with the formation of new rivers. This evolutionary history is most consistent with a Young Amazon Flooded Forest Taxa model, suggesting Saimiri has always maintained a lowland wetlands niche and was able to greatly expand its range with the transition from a lacustrine to a riverine system in Amazonia. Saimiri vanzolinii was recovered as the sister group to one clade of Saimiri ustus, discordant with the traditional Gothic vs. Roman morphological division of squirrel monkeys. We also found paraphyly within each of the currently recognized species: S. sciureus, S. ustus, and S. macrodon. We discuss evidence for taxonomic revision within the genus Saimiri, and the need for future work using nuclear markers.",

      "abstract": "To better understand the threats posed by human activities on cetaceans, we compiled published studies and determined where, how, and by whom the research on this subject has been conducted in Brazil. We also determined which cetacean species were mostly investigated in these studies. We gathered the available scientific literature published from 1986 to 2016 that contained search terms in English that depicted major cetacean threats. Then, we developed a collaboration network among the authors' institutions and generated a distribution map of the investigated threats and study areas. From the 1047 compiled publications, we selected 103 studies that precisely addressed cetacean threats. The selected studies were carried out by 82 institutions from 12 countries. Most of these institutions were universities (n = 55), followed by non-governmental organizations (n = 15) and research institutes (n = 12). Among the two cetacean suborders, odontocetes were the most representative, with Sotalia guianensis and Pontoporia blainvillei present in 50 and 38 publications, respectively. For mysticetes, publications on Megaptera novaeangliae (n = 6) and Eubalaena australis (n = 5) were the most common. Among the addressed threats, more than half (54.4%) of the publications focused on pollution, followed by bycatch (19.4%) and vessel traffic (10.7%). Most of the study areas took place in the states of Rio de Janeiro (22.4%), São Paulo (19.7%), and Rio Grande do Sul (12.9%). Six institutions were the most prevalent in the collaboration networks, and their location corresponded to hotspots of cetacean diversity. Our findings may contribute to identifying research priorities and guide the conservation of cetacean species in Brazil.",

      "abstract": "Ecosystem services are the bridge between nature and society, and are essential elements of community well-being. The Wet Tropics Australia, is environmentally and biologically diverse, and supplies numerous ecosystem services. It contributes to the community well-being of this region, Australian national economy and global climate change mitigation efforts. However, the ecosystem services in the region have rarely been assessed undermining strategic landscape planning to sustain their future flow. In this study, we attempted to: (i) assess the quantity of five regulating ecosystem services – global climate regulation, air quality regulation, erosion regulation, nutrient regulation, and cyclone protection, and three provisioning ecosystem services – habitat provision, energy provision and timber provision across rainforests, sclerophyll forests and rehabilitated plantation forests; (ii) evaluate the variation of supply of those regulating and provisioning ecosystem services across environmental gradients, such as rainfall, temperature, and elevation; (iii) show the relationships among those ecosystem services; and (iv) identify the hotspots of single and multiple ecosystem services supply across the landscape. The results showed that rainforests possess a very high capacity to supply single and multiple ecosystem services, and the hotspots for most of the regulating and provisioning ecosystem services are found in upland rainforest followed by lowland rainforest, and upland sclerophyll forest. Elevation, rainfall and temperature gradients along with forest structure are the main determinant factors for the quantity of ecosystem services supplied across the three forest types. The correlation among ecosystem services may be positive or negative depending on the ecosystem service category and vegetation type. The rehabilitated plantation forests may provide some ecosystem services comparable to the rainforest. The results demonstrated disturbance regimes (such as tropical cyclones) may have influenced the usual spatial trend of ecosystem service values. This study will assist decision makers in incorporating ecosystem services into their natural resource management planning, and for practitioners to identify the areas with higher values of specific and multiple ecosystem services.",

      "abstract": "This work assessed the carbon storage and sequestration potential in the planted mangrove stands of Avicennia marina of different age groups (16–27.2 years), as influenced by vegetation and soil characteristics in an estuarine system of southeast coast of India. The carbon storage was 22-folds higher in soil and 56-folds greater in both tree biomass and soil in the mangrove stands than that in non-planted site. The carbon sequestration was 90-folds higher in soil and 9890-folds greater in both tree biomass and soil than that in control site. Hence, mangrove planting had an extraordinary potential for carbon sequestration in barren areas. The carbon sequestration and storage increased with increasing levels of silt, clay, moisture and nutrients (N, S, Cu, K, P, Fe, Zn, Mn, and Mg) in the mangrove soil. In contrast, the carbon sequestration and storage reduced with increasing levels of temperature, pore-water salinity, pH, bulk density and sand in the mangrove soil. This work calls for an attention on the mangrove stands of low carbon holding for remedial measures through soil management to improve the carbon storage and sequestration potential towards mitigating the global warming.",

      "abstract": "The statistical and probabilistic analyses of a database of Upper Cretaceous tropical dinoflagellate cysts from Venezuela allow us to recognize 21 species in the optimal stratigraphic sequence. Compilation of the dinoflagellate cysts reported in ten studies of Upper Cretaceous tropical localities from northern South America and the Gulf of Guinea allow the recognition of a rich assemblage (262 species), dominated by gonyaulacoid (129 spp), followed by protoperidinioid (82 spp), areoligeroid (29 spp), gymnodinioid (12 spp) and ceratioid (10 spp) taxa. Seventy-three species in the tropical database are reported in both regions, allowing the age calibration of the optimal sequence from Venezuela. The proposed final sequence of bioevents allows recognition of most stages in tropical Upper Cretaceous strata. The high diversity of the Spiniferites-Achomosphaera group and scarcity of Impagidinium indicates shallow marine depositional environments for most of the Upper Cretaceous tropical localities included. The dominance of gonyaulacoid species in the tropical database suggests that these were the dominant primary producers in the tropical Late Cretaceous oceans.",

      "abstract": "Forest structure and biomass production of Kandelia obovata Sheue, H.Y.Liu & J.Yong mangrove plantations in Northern Viet Nam were investigated for 1- to 20-year-old stands. The measurements were implemented over the study plots which were set up in 1-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-, 9-, 10-, 18-, 19- and 20-year-old K. obovata plantations. Tree density, stem diameter at 30 cm height (D0.3) and tree height (H) were measured. These parameters increased with stand age from young to mature stage with the ranges from 3,700 ± 1,609 tree.ha−1 to 26,500 ± 1,153 tree.ha−1, 0.67 ± 0.18 cm to 8.73 ± 3.16 cm, and 0.46 ± 0.16 m to 4.12 ± 0.96 m for density, stem diameter at 30 cm height and stem height, respectively. Fifty trees were harvested to find an allometric relationship between tree size and dry mass. Allocation models were developed to estimate above ground biomass. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), the root mean square error (RMSE), R2, and P-value of the models were calculated and compared to find the fitness models for biomass evaluation. The best correlation satisfied between D0.3*H and dry mass of tree components and total above ground biomass (AGB). Our results showed a rise in above ground biomass of 1- to 20-year-old K. obovata plantations, which ranges from 0.04 ± 0.02 Mg ha−1 to 115.39 ± 15.34 Mg ha−1. Of this, ~87% of the above ground biomass was represented by stems and branches. Above ground biomass and its components linearly increased with stand age. It was found that the biomass in the study area increased with an annual rate of 4.33 Mg ha−1 yr−1. These results provide a view of mangrove plantations in assessing the biomass of mangroves continuously from young to mature stages of reforestation.",

      "abstract": "Mangroves have long been associated with human populations, as coastal communities rely on the various ecosystem services that mangroves provide. However, human degradation and destruction of mangrove forests is common, despite and because of our reliance on them as valuable ecosystems. Mangrove research and management must elucidate and reconcile these conflicts to maintain mangrove forests and the services that humans depend on. To better understand the complex dynamics, interactions and relationships that exist between mangroves and coastal communities, the 5th Mangrove Macrobenthos and Management (MMM5) conference was held in Singapore in July 2019, with the theme “Mangroves and People: Impacts and Interactions”. This theme was chosen because Southeast Asia is the epicentre of ongoing mangrove loss, and a large number of coastal communities in the region rely on the ecosystem services that mangroves provide. The 32 papers published in this Special Issue represent the breadth of mangrove research presented at MMM5, including topics in faunal biology, ecosystem ecology, genetics, physical geography, biogeochemistry, remote sensing and the social sciences. The articles are characterized under the following topics: 1) mangrove ecosystem functioning; 2) range expansion of mangroves; 3) ecosystem services of mangroves; 4) anthropogenic and natural threats to mangroves; and 5) the management and social-ecology of mangroves. This Special Issue highlights the current state of the art of mangrove research and application, and describes a number of emerging new ideas and research opportunities that will continue to advance mangrove ecosystem science into the future.",

      "abstract": "Long term and high resolution data on water discharge, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and contaminant concentrations in rivers are required for a better understanding of particulate transfers from the continental areas to the seas. The aim of this study was to provide a novel estimation of annual fluxes of SPM and related pollutants in the Rhône River from Lake Geneva to the Mediterranean Sea by combining high frequency or time-integrative monitoring and novel relations between SPM concentration (Cs) and water discharge (Q). At six stations of the Rhône Sediment Observatory (OSR), SPM fluxes were calculated over the 2000–2016 period by combining observational data and Cs-Q relations. Monthly average concentrations of mercury (Hg) and PCB 180 were obtained by analysis of SPM samples collected in time integrative particle traps between 2011 and 2016. These pollutants were selected because of the well documented contamination of the Rhône watershed by these substances. Inter-annual fluxes at the Rhône River outlet averaged 6.6 Mt. yr−1 for SPM, 572 kg yr−1 for Hg and 14 kg yr−1 for PCB 180. The Isère and Durance tributaries were found to be the main contributors of SPM fluxes. Annual SPM budgets were not balanced, suggesting deposition, remobilization of bottom sediments and/or contributions from non-monitored tributaries. The SPM sampled at the outlet was more contaminated than the combined SPM inputs from the monitored tributaries, suggesting that intermediate sources of contamination were not captured in the budget.\nWe use first field-based observations of precipitation and river isotopic chemistry from a three-year study (2009–2011) in rainforest and nearby savannah in central Guyana at the northern rim of the Amazon rainforest to establish the quality of modelled or remotely-sensed datasets. Our 3 years of data capture a reduced rainfall regime in 2009 and an extended wet season in 2010, in contrast to the widely documented Amazonian floods in 2009 and droughts in 2010. Comparisons of observed precipitation with satellite derived TRMM and ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis precipitation show that both of these data sets capture the general pattern of seasonality, but substantially underestimate rainfall amounts in the primary wet season (by up to 50% and 72% respectively). The TRMM dataset is generally better at characterising the main dry season from September to December but the ERA-Interim model can overestimate precipitation in the dry season by up to 175%. Our new data on isotopic chemistry of river waters show that δ2H/δ18O values in this region are broadly consistent with interpolated global datasets of modelled precipitation isotopic signatures. The dominance of isotopically lighter water derived from the rains of the ITCZ during the wet season provides evidence of the close coupling of water chemistry of headwater rivers on the northern rim of Amazonia to the positioning of the ITCZ over the region. Our results highlight the challenge in understanding and representing local scale hydrological and biogeochemical characteristics using regional scale model data. We argue that combining point and local scale field data with larger scale model data is necessary to progress towards a comprehensive understanding of climate–hydrology interactions in Amazonia.\nThis paper presents an evolutionary model for a coastal barrier in the southernmost coastal sector of Brazil during the Holocene. The dataset is based on 15–20 m drill cores and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) records. The model barrier evolution has two main steps. The first step is the transgression of the barrier controlled by sea-level rise during the Postglacial Marine Transgression, which ended at approximately 6–5 cal ka. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the coastal plain began to be flooded by lagoonal waters between ∼10 and 6.7 cal ka. The second step comprises a barrier transgression controlled by a negative sediment budget of the beach system during the last 6–5 cal ka in a period of an overall slow sea-level fall of approximately 2 m. During the second step, the transgressive barrier migrated because of coastal erosion (the negative sediment budget) and the landward transference of sand by wind and lagoonal delta washout.\nDuring fieldwork carried out in January 2009 at Aurora do Tocantins (Tocantins State, northern Brazil), we recovered a fragmentary right maxilla (UNIRIO-PM 1006) of Catagonus stenocephalus from a sedimentary deposit of presumed late Pleistocene age in a karstic cave. This paper aims to: (1) provide the first record of C. stenocephalus in the northern region of Brazil (and consequently, also the northernmost one); (2) update the geographic distribution of C. stenocephalus; (3) present a date for the specimen; and (4) discuss the palaeoenvironmental and palaeobiogeographical implications of the finding. The species C. stenocephalus (Lund) is known from the Bonaerian (middle Pleistocene) and Lujanian (late Pleistocene to earliest Holocene) ages in Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil and Bolivia. The new record presented here extends the geographical distribution of C. stenocephalus more than 1000 km north from the former northernmost record (caves of Lagoa Santa region). Peccaries of the genus Catagonus have several morphological features associated with cursorial habits in relatively open and dry environments. The new distributional range of C. stenocephalus is coincident with the Chacoan subregion, characterized by dry climates and open areas. As the studied material comes from the top of the carbonate layer, this may suggest that the deposition of the C. stenocephalus remains described here is synchronous with the onset of a wetter climate phase. This argument is also in accordance with the datation results, around 20 ky BP, just after the last glacial maximum. This increasingly wet climate, which may also be related to the climatic changes that occurred during the late Pleistocene/early Holocene, could be a factor in the extinction of C. stenocephalus in South America.\nTwo sediment cores from Mauritia flexuosa palm swamps have been studied by pollen and charcoal analysis. The cores Fazenda Cigana (FC) and Terra Indígena Aningal (TIA) were taken from a savanna-forest ecotone area in the Roraima State, northern Brazilian Amazon. Based on 5 radiocarbon dates, these records allow the reconstruction of the vegetation fire and climate dynamics during the past 1550 years. At the FC site was recorded a higher proportion of forest cover, suggesting local wetter climatic conditions favorable for forest expansion, especially by gallery forests, between 1550 and 1400 cal yr BP. Stands of M. flexuosa started to establish on the site indicating sufficient soil moisture. From 1400 to 1050 cal yr BP, forest cover retreated while savanna, and the Mauritia palm swamp expanded considerably. The FC site was marked by savanna and Mauritia cover with a slight increase of forest between ca. 1050 and 900 cal yr BP. From 900 to 300 cal yr BP the savanna and palm swamp taxa became dominant and the forest area decreased. At the TIA site the savanna cover was dominant between 1200 and 1000 cal yr BP. From 1000 to 700 forest expanded while savanna and Mauritia palm swamp reduced. Between 700 and 300 cal yr BP savanna and Mauritia palm swamp increased and forest area decreased. The high amount of charred particles found in the sediments, indicate fires with a marked increase between 1400 to 1000 cal yr BP (FC site) and 700 to 300 cal yr BP (TIA site), and probably caused the retreat of forest cover during these two time intervals. The relatively lower fire activity after 300 cal yr BP until present-day favored the increase of forested area at both TIA and FC sites. The arrival of the European settler and the subsequent introduction of cattle, is suggested as the main reason for the decrease of fire in the study region. The results point the fire caused by indigenous people as the principal controlling factor for forest and savanna dynamics during the past 1550 years.\nA metre-thick ultramafic lamprophyre dyke intrudes the basement of the Tandilia belt at the Sierra Alta de Vela, Argentina. A petrological and geochemical study of this rock and associated small dykes indicates a predominantly calc-alkaline trend. Phlogopite K–Ar dating of the ultramafic lamprophyre gave a minimum age of 1928 ± 54 Ma as a late event of the Transamazonian Orogeny, which is well represented in the basement of the Tandilia belt.\nAn electron microprobe study indicates the presence of phlogopite, albite, chromite and Cr-rich phenocrysts and Cr-free microphenocrysts of diopside as primary minerals. Subsequent to deformation at the contacts with the wall rock, metasomatism generated strongly zoned amphibole (edenite, pargasite, Mg-hastingite and tremolite compositions) and andradite as well as chlorite, sericite, albite, apatite and calcite. The central zone of the lamprophyre is almost undeformed and exhibits some ocellar texture. Geochemical and isotopic signatures of the lamprophyre suggest that its magma source may have previously undergone incompatible element enrichment of the mantle source, representing the original precursor magma for the calc-alkaline dyke series of the Sierra Alta de Vela.\nA new middle Miocene vertebrate fauna from Peruvian Amazonia is described. It yields the marsupials Sipalocyon sp. (Hathliacynidae) and Marmosa (Micoureus) cf. laventica (Didelphidae), as well as an unidentified glyptodontine xenarthran and the rodents Guiomys sp. (Caviidae), “Scleromys” sp., cf. quadrangulatus-schurmanni-colombianus (Dinomyidae), an unidentified acaremyid, and cf. Microsteiromys sp. (Erethizontidae). Apatite Fission Track provides a detrital age (17.1 ± 2.4 Ma) for the locality, slightly older than its inferred biochronological age (Colloncuran-early Laventan South American Land Mammal Ages: ∼15.6–13.0 Ma). Put together, both the mammalian assemblage and lithology of the fossil-bearing level point to a mixture of tropical rainforest environment and more open habitats under a monsoonal-like tropical climate. The fully fluvial origin of the concerned sedimentary sequence suggests that the Amazonian Madre de Dios Subandean Zone was not part of the Pebas mega-wetland System by middle Miocene times. This new assemblage seems to reveal a previously undocumented “spatiotemporal transition” between the late early Miocene assemblages from high latitudes (Patagonia and Southern Chile) and the late middle Miocene faunas of low latitudes (Colombia, Perú, Venezuela, and ?Brazil).\nParticulate suspended matter concentration (SPM) were estimated over a 8 year time period (2002–2010) in the coastal waters of French Guiana from a regional algorithm applied to the MODIS monthly reflectance measurements. Comparison between SPOT images and MODIS-SPM maps revealed the strong spatio-temporal coupling between in water SPM and the dynamics of local (i.e. Kourou and Cayenne) mud banks. Highest MODIS SPM values (>13 g m−3 approximately) can be significantly associated with the subtidal part of the banks as well as to the related turbid plume. The migration of these mud banks induces strong interannual changes in SPM reaching up to 6% year−1 within increasing and decreasing patchy areas distributed alternatively along the coastline of French Guiana. Mud banks migration rates derived from MODIS SPM data reach in average about 2 km year−1 in agreement with previous studies. The MODIS time series have allowed for a detailed description of the seasonality and interannual variations in the in-water SPM loads. Seasonal changes in SPM are related to the onset of the trade wind season. Marked non-linear patterns including a sharp evolution in the SPM values around 2005 as well as additional high frequency modulations have been emphasized within the upward and downward SPM trend regions. Concurrent temporal variations in the frequency of northward swells (favoring mud banks migration and reworking) as well as interannual changes in the amount of sediment delivered by the Amazon River have been shown to play a major role in the SPM temporal patterns observed in the French Guiana coastal waters. Our results clearly demonstrate the advantage for ocean color data to describe mud banks dynamics through the assessment of in water SPM temporal variability.",

There is a detailed description of the geographic distribution of the most important species (as Trypanosoma cruzi vectors) of the genera Rhodnius, Triatoma, and Panstrongylus in the Americas. A particularly important update in the distribution of Rhodnius prolixus and Triatoma infestans is made, after the successful performance of the vector control interventions in Central America and Southern Cone of South America, respectively. The relatively good knowledge on the occurrence of domestic populations of the main vector species of Triatominae allowed the association between their geographic distribution and climatic and land cover environmental variables, using a variety of species distribution models. This aspect is developed mainly for Triatoma and Rhodnius species. At the end of this chapter, we developed a few ideas about the effect of global warming over the distribution of Triatominae in America.",

      "abstract": "Ongoing agricultural expansion in Amazonia and the surrounding areas of Brazil is expected to continue over the next several decades as global food demand increases. The transition of natural forest and savannah ecosystems to pastureland and agricultural crops is predicted to create warmer and drier atmospheric conditions than the native vegetation. Using a coupled ecosystem regional atmospheric model (EDBRAMS) we investigate the expected impacts of predicted future land use on the climate of South America. The climate response in the model simulations is generally consistent with expectations from previous global modeling simulations with drier conditions resulting from deforestation, however the changes in precipitation are relatively small (on order of a few percent). Local drying is driven primarily by decreases in evapo-transpiration associated with the loss of forest, and concomitant increases in runoff. Significant changes in convectively available potential energy (CAPE) and convective inhibition (CIN) during the transition to the wet season indicate that the decrease in surface latent heat flux is indeed leading to a drier atmosphere, however these changes occur around a mean climatological state that is already very favorable for convection, and thus lead to relatively small changes in precipitation. If, however, these land use changes were to occur under a background state of drier conditions, such as those predicted for the future global climate model experiments, this additional atmospheric drying may be sufficient to decrease precipitation more substantially.",

As “water towers” of the Earth mountains are sources of the mightiest world rivers and play a pivotal role for global biodiversity, freshwater, and sediment supply. Distinct morphological, climatic, hydrological, hydrochemical, and biological features of mountainous river ecosystems, compared to lowland ones, make them particularly fragile and vulnerable to human interference. Despite a number of remote mountain areas and rivers still remaining intact from direct human pressures, the majority of mountain ecosystems, are being increasingly threatened by adverse local and global changes driven by market economy. To efficiently conserve and sustainably use mountain ecosystems and contribute to the survival of the planet, it is critical to change our standards and life attitudes by realizing and appreciating our immediate connection to the global ecosystem, change attitudes and current consumption patterns, and stimulate the ways our global society functions and interacts with the natural environment.",

      "abstract": "Arboviruses such as West Nile, Zika, chikungunya, dengue, and yellow fever viruses have become highly significant global pathogens through unexpected, explosive outbreaks. While the rapid progression and frequency of recent arbovirus outbreaks is associated with long-term changes in human behavior (globalization, urbanization, climate change), there are direct mosquito–virus interactions which drive shifts in host range and alter virus transmission. This review summarizes how virus–mosquito interactions are critical for these viruses to become global pathogens at molecular, physiological, evolutionary, and epidemiological scales. Integrated proactive approaches are required in order to effectively manage the emergence of mosquito-borne arboviruses, which appears likely to continue into the indefinite future.",

      "abstract": "Understanding food web functioning through the study of natural bio-indicators may constitute a valuable and original approach. In the context of jellyfish proliferation in many overexploited marine ecosystems studying the spatio-temporal foraging patterns of the giant “jellyvore” leatherback turtle turns out to be particularly relevant. Here we analyzed long-term tracking data to assess spatio-temporal foraging patterns in 21 leatherback turtles during their pluri-annual migration in the Northern Atlantic. Through an analytical approach based on the animal's own motion (independent of currents) and diving behavior distinct zones of high and low foraging success were identified. High foraging success occurred in a sub-equatorial zone spanning the width of the Atlantic and at high (>30°N) latitudes. Between these zones in the centre of North Atlantic gyre there was low foraging success. This “ocean desert” area was traversed at high speed by leatherbacks on their way to more productive areas at higher latitudes. Animals traveled slowly in high foraging success areas and dived shallower (17.2±8.0kmday−1 and 53.6±33.1m mean±SD respectively) than in low foraging success areas (51.0±13.1kmday−1 and 81.8±56.2m mean±SD respectively). These spatio-temporal foraging patterns seem to relatively closely match the main features of the integrated meso-zooplankton distribution in the North Atlantic. Our method of defining high foraging success areas is intuitive and relatively easy to implement but also takes into account the impact of oceanic currents on animal's behavior.",

      "abstract": "Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in the Caribbean and Pacific have gone from a place of self-sufficiency and energy independence, during pre-colonial times, to a position, in more recent times, of being (often heavily) dependent on both imported capital (loans and aid) and imported sources of energy. This paper asserts that the current dependence of Caribbean and Pacific SIDS on both development assistance from donor agencies and imported fossil fuels is not coincidental, but rather, it was due to the transition of these islands from subsistence agriculture to export-oriented economies, primarily to serve the interests of more developed metropolitan countries. These interests have included the provision of cheap raw materials and agricultural produce to imperial nations; which has meant that SIDS needed to develop export orientated economies requiring both financial capital and energy supply usually over and above that available locally. The impact of colonisation on domestic energy use and demand in SIDS is thus briefly outlined so as to make clear how these nations transitioned from self-sufficiency to dependence on foreign capital and energy. It is upon this backdrop that the current dependence of SIDS on international aid, particularly with regards to the energy sector, has been analysed, along with its influence on energy policy in SIDS. This paper suggests that while imported finance and energy have been crucial to the past development of SIDS, the extent of reliance upon external financial assistance and energy imports at present is a cause for concern not only due to long term energy security issues but also because of the climate change implications of fossil fuel use. The concern is also pressing within the context of long term debt accumulation. It is argued herein that closer attention should be paid to local capacity building, training and institutional strengthening to enable a transition to renewable energy in place of fossil fuel based power. In terms of long term resilience such capacity building could eventually include the means for the production of renewable energy technology components.",

Because the family position of Leptoglanis (Bagridae/Amphiliidae) is under debate, this genus has been taken as an out-group too. Results of the study indicate that: 1) the Amphiliidae is not a monophyletic group and must now be restricted to the genera Amphilius and Paramphilius; the two subfamilies Amphiliinae and Doumeinae are separated by the sisorids Euchiloglanis (with most of the glyptosternid fishes) and Glyptothorax (with most of the non-glyptosternid fishes); 2) no synapomorphies were found for the subfamily Amphiliinae. 3) The five genera of subfamily Doumeinae constitute a monophyletic group, Andersonia being the sister-group of the four other genera; subfamily Doumeinae + Leptoglanis form the family Doumeidae. The glyptosternids no longer belong to the Sisoridae (family restricted to the non-glyptosternids) and represent the new family Glyptosternidae.\nRésumé\nLa famille des Amphiliidae, poissons-chats d'eau douce d'Afrique, a été revue sur la base de 73 caractères ostéologiques avec comme out-groups les Diplomystidae, les † Hypsidoridae, les Amblycipitidae, les Sisoridae et les Bagridae.

      "abstract": "Renewable energy is fundamental for sustainable development challenges and social sciences advances. The development agenda prescribes to pursue renewable energy policies as a pillar of energy security and sustainable development in both developed and developing countries. A major policy implication for renewable energy derives from entrepreneurship boosting, targeting women, rural, youth, and vulnerable categories, where microfinance and resilience policies have found a wide consensus. The present work exploits a statistical approach to measure energy policy effectiveness, making use of the brand-new IBRD-World Bank release SDG7 Tracking: The Energy Progress Report. A composite indicator of renewable energy policy is built, exploring different perspectives. The determinants of energy policy effectiveness are analyzed. A statistical comparison of the different results is relevant to ensure robustness implications. We discover that countries endowed with natural resources, such as Brazil, perform better in renewable energy consumption. We confirm that green countries, e.g. the Nordic region, maintain a high renewable energy consumption attitude. We also validate that oil exporters – and notably most of the Arab countries –, are usually less prone to use renewable energy. These implications are foremost for the vulnerable empowerment and societal challenges required to foster the energy transition.",

These papers were developed from presentations delivered at two international conferences held in 2018: the TRAMIN (“Socio-environmental Trajectories of Mining Territories”) conference and the Social Geology session at the RFG (“Resources for Future Generations”) conference, that took place respectively in Chambéry (France) and Vancouver (Canada). The introduction paper situates these pieces in the wider literature, exploring the connections between mineral resources and the development of societies that exploit, transform and sell them. It also argues that using a polyphonic notion such as “trajectories” allows for the adoption of an interdisciplinary approach leading to key insights on sustainability for mining territories.",

Parsimony analysis of endemicity, UPGMA clustering and NMDS ordination were computed with data of 18 localities and 245 species, all indicating that the northern Atlantic Forest is more related to the Amazon than to its southern portion. Also the results agree with the hypothesis that the Brejos Nordestinos is a distinct biota from both the Amazon and Atlantic Forest. Annual temperature and rainfall are strongly related with the resulting NDMS site scores. A distance similarity decay of similarity analysis suggests a moderate to low, but statistically significant, influence of the geographic distance on assemblages' composition. The limited distribution of many poroid fungal taxa also emphasizes the fragility of these organisms to habitat loss.",

      "abstract": "Mangroves of New Caledonia act as a buffer between a lagoon of more than 20,000km2 and the Island, which suffers intense processes of erosion resulting from urbanization and natural resources exploitation. This preliminary study aims at determining how heavy metals are distributed in mangrove sediments and pore-waters in relationship with their organic content. To reach our goal, a series of 50-cm deep cores were collected in the mangrove of Conception Bay. The various coring sites are representative of live forests (Avicennia marina, Rhizophora stylosa), dead forest, and intertidal unvegetated area. The ranges of concentrations in sediments were the following (μmolg−1): Cu (0.08 to 0.51), Co (0.01 to 0.38), Ni (0.03 to 3.55), Cr (0.36 to 3.11), Zn (0.68 to 2.36), Mn (1.13 to 5.0) and Fe (22.64 to 721.69). Heavy metals distribution within sediments and pore-water appear to result from diagenetic processes linked to OM decomposition. Beneath the dead Avicennia forest and in the unvegetated sediments, the higher the organic content, the higher the metal concentration in the solid phase. Beneath living mangrove stands, despite a higher organic content, as well as higher sulphur content, heavy metals concentrations were not higher than those measured in the other sampling sites. Beneath these forests, redox conditions were mainly controlled by the length of waterlogging and the activity of root system. We suggest that, because of the specificity of the Avicennia root system and its position in the intertidal zone, heavy metals are more bioavailable and potentially more mobile than beneath Rhizophora stand.",

      "abstract": "Because many environmental threats span national boundaries, transboundary networks have emerged as a form of multi-stakeholder platform to support environmental governance (EG). There are transboundary networks in various ecologically important regions of the world such as the Amazon. However, there remains a need for systematic analyses to adequately evaluate the contributions of transboundary networks to EG. This paper takes up the case of the “MAP Initiative”, a transboundary network in the tri-national frontier of the southwestern Amazon that sought to support EG. We examine three key questions: 1) how do transboundary networks motivate participants to engage in collaboration across boundaries for EG, 2) how do transboundary networks evolve structurally as well as strategically to increase their impact on EG, and 3) can transboundary networks generate outcomes beyond information sharing for EG? The analysis draws on historical documents, participant observation, and key informant interviews about the MAP Initiative. The findings confirm that transboundary networks motivate cross-border exchanges in multiple ways, they evolve structurally in multiple ways that increase their capacity, and that evolution supports multiple forms of activities and outcomes that support EG. We conclude with a discussion of the contributions and challenges of transboundary networks regarding EG.",

      "abstract": "Mangrove forests can fix and store high quantities of carbon both in their soil and in their biomass, the latter peaking in the equatorial regions and decreasing with latitude. In Vietnam, more than 80% of the mangroves develop either in the Mekong Delta or in the Can Gio Estuary, which are characterized by tropical monsoon climates. Most of these mangroves were planted and are dominated by Rhizophora apiculata Blume. The main objectives of this study were to determine forest structure, above-ground biomass and carbon conversion factors for each tree component in order to obtain allometric equations and to derive carbon stocks for managed Rhizophora stands of different ages developing within this context. Thirty-six trees, having a diameter at breast height (DBH) ranging from 7.0 to 36.2 cm, from a planted mangrove forest were harvested in Ca Mau (Mekong Delta) to determine allometric equations. In addition, thirteen plots were established in both Ca Mau and Can Gio mangrove forests, to determine above-ground carbon densities. We proposed the following specific allometric equation to estimate total above-ground biomass (kg) for managed R. apiculata mangrove stands in Southern Vietnam: WTotal = 0.38363 * DBH2.2348 (R2 = 0.976, SE = 1.17, F = 1401, P < 0.001). The total above-ground biomass ranged from 135.4 to 523.6 Mg ha−1 depending on forest age and tree density. Consequently, and taking into account a carbon conversion factor of 44.09%, carbon stocks in the above-ground biomass of R. apiculata mangrove forests in Southern Vietnam ranged from 59.7 to 230.9 Mg C ha−1. The mean carbon partitioning in the tree biomass was: 77.11% for trunks, 11.87% for branches, 8.66% for prop roots, and 2.36% for leaves. However, this distribution, as well as annual height increments and biomass increase rates, also varied with forest age and tree densities. We suggested that tree density reduction through thinning activities allowed easier tree development, resulting in an increased biomass with enhanced allocation to branches and above-ground prop roots for the stability of the trees. Using the specific allometric equation and specific carbon conversion factor reduced the uncertainty in the estimation of above-ground biomass and carbon stocks.",

      "abstract": "Acid soil savannas of tropical America are a vast resource to expand agricultural production, alleviate the pressure on tropical rainforest and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. During the past three decades there have been major changes in land use in the Cerrados of Brazil and to a lesser extent in the Llanos of Colombia. Monocropping and improved pasture grasses were adopted widely to boost crop and animal production. Various types of integrated crop-livestock systems and no-till cropping systems were introduced to not only recuperate degraded pastures but also to sustain crop and livestock productivity. Several studies showed that well-managed pastures based on deep rooted tropical forage grass and legume species could accumulate significant amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC) in deeper soil layers. Among the number of factors that influence SOC accumulation, deep rooting ability of grasses and high root turnover seem to play a major role in accumulation of SOC in deeper soil layers in the form of particulate organic carbon (POC) and mineral associated organic carbon (MAOC). This review provides insights toward some key approaches and management options to increase both POC and MAOC accumulation and particularly MAOC accumulation in deeper soil layers in crop-livestock systems. There are some important gaps in our knowledge, particularly regarding the influence of length of pasture phase on MAOC accumulation in deeper soil layers from crop-livestock systems. Finally, we highlight the importance of land use policies and suggest some future research priorities for consideration to increase benefits from the use of integrated crop-livestock systems in acid soil savannas.",

      "abstract": "Ecosystem service (ES) assessments have flourished globally in recent years and are now frequently used by policymakers and environmental managers. However, data scarce regions continue to be less well studied, limiting the comprehensiveness of the approach and its potential benefits. Here we aim to assess multiple ES and their spatial relationships in a region with high tropical forest cover, the state of Amapá, in the Brazilian Amazon. We develop a simple method to measure nine ES, identify spatial associations between them, and explore the impact of land use change on the capacity of forests to provide those services. The ES analysed include biodiversity, regional climate regulation, indigenous heritage, agricultural production, and NTFP extraction. Both negative (n = 20) and positive (n = 12) spatial associations are found, with agricultural land and forests having the highest total ES provision. We also show that this varies nonlinearly with distance to forest edges. In the face of currently unavoidable data scarcities in high biodiversity tropical areas, we show that this approach can provide useful evidence for land use management decisions.",

The goal of this study was to model the potential distribution of A. grandis and discuss the aspect of its ecological niche. The species distribution model was built using the Maximum Entropy method - Maxent, which showed an extensive environmental suitability area in all continents of tropical and subtropical climates. The main prediction variables for the A. grandis establishment were average annual temperature and rainfall.

Here, we present a systematic emission study of “hyperdominant” tree species in the Amazon Basin. Across 162 individuals, distributed among 25 botanical families and 113 species, isoprenoid emissions were widespread among both early and late successional species (isoprene: 61.9% of the species; monoterpenes: 15.0%; both isoprene and monoterpenes: 9.7%). The hyperdominant species (69) across the top five most abundant genera, which make up about 50% of all individuals in the Basin, had a similar abundance of isoprenoid emitters (isoprene: 63.8%; monoterpenes: 17.4%; both 11.6%). Among the abundant genera, only Pouteria had a low frequency of isoprene emitting species (15.8% of 19 species). In contrast, Protium, Licania, Inga, and Eschweilera were rich in isoprene emitting species (83.3% of 12 species, 61.1% of 18 species, 100% of 8 species, and 100% of 12 species, respectively). Light response curves of individuals in each of the five genera showed light-dependent, photosynthesis-linked emission rates of isoprene and monoterpenes. Importantly, in every genus, we observed species with light-dependent isoprene emissions together with monoterpenes including β-ocimene. These observations support the emerging view of the evolution of isoprene synthases from β-ocimene synthases. Our results have important implications for understanding isoprenoid function-evolution relationships and the development of more accurate Earth System Models.",

      "abstract": "Avoiding whinges from various and potentially conflicting stakeholders is a major challenge for sustainable development and for the identification of sustainability scenarios or policies for biodiversity and ecosystem services. It turns out that independently complying with whinge thresholds and constraints of these stakeholders is not sufficient because dynamic ecological-economic interactions and uncertainties occur. Thus more demanding no whinge standards are needed. In this paper, we first argue that these new boundaries can be endogenously exhibited with the mathematical concepts of viability kernel and viable controls. Second, it is shown how these no whinge kernels have components, such as harvesting of resources, that should remain within safe corridor while some other components, in particular biodiversity, have only lower conservation limits. Thus, using radar charts, we show how this no whinge kernels can take the shape of a tree that we name viability tree. These trees of viability capture the idea that the unbounded renewal potential of biodiversity combined with a bounded use of the different ecosystem services are crucial ingredients for the sustainability of socio-ecosystems and the design of no whinge policies reconciling the different stakeholders involved.",

      "abstract": "In view of the scenario of global warming, understanding how individuals disperse and populations fluctuate in response to climatic extremes is becoming increasingly important. Thereby, we used a capture-mark-recapture approach on Columbina minuta and Columbina picui in two Caatinga physiognomies (shrubby-woodland and savanna) during and following a prolonged drought in northeastern Brazil. We evaluated three hypotheses: density is higher in the savanna, doves are more abundant during the rainy season, and doves are able to undertake regional movements in response to drought. We used Huggins closed population models to estimate detection rates and population size. The results revealed low capture and recapture rates, greater abundance in the savanna, a higher density of C. minuta in both study areas, and a higher density of both species in the rainy season. We also observed that the prolonged drought has negatively impacted on doves density. The recovery of banded individuals at other sites indicates that nomadism may be the principal strategy adopted by doves to endure periods of drought. Our findings show that conservation units in the Caatinga are important to conservation of granivorous birds and contribute to understanding the birds' strategies to face seasonality and severely dry periods in semiarid areas.",

      "abstract": "This article explores the impact of electricity production broken down by energy source (fossils and renewables) on carbon dioxide emissions in South America over the 1980–2010 period. The contribution of the manuscript is in the analysis of the relationships between carbon dioxide emissions, the energy mix in electricity generation and its implications for economic growth in a region still insufficiently studied. Using ARDL approach, the empirical findings provide evidence of the cross-sectional dependence in the data and existence of cointegration. The pollution has a relationship with economic growth, and the fossil electricity in short-run. The estimations strongly reveal that renewable energy has a negative effect on CO2 emissions in long run. Also, in the long-run, fossil electricity has shown results become statistically insignificant. However, the adjustment mechanism corrected the model by around 27% in the following period. In this way, the electricity production at aggregate level is used a factor environmental pressure and as an indicator of economic activity in South America countries, where the renewable energy with an increasing long-run effect, remains an efficient substitute for the fossil-electricity. Thus, we recommend to the countries of South America that they maintain the long-term efforts to produce electricity from renewable sources.",

      "abstract": "Deforestation is considered the main human-induced and short-term threat to the persistence of forest species in the Amazon. Long-lasting and high-intensity deforestation, low coverage of protected areas, and high level of species endemism make the Belém Endemism Area (BEA) particularly more vulnerable than the rest of the Amazon area. However, this occurrence remains strongly neglected in global and regional conservation analyses. In this study, we used species distribution modeling and remote sensing data to map the richness pattern of endangered birds from the Amazon and assessed the species' conservation status based on landscape patterns of forest remnants. Our results revealed that the BEA's imperiled avifauna presents the most significant state of vulnerability to extinction compared with other areas of endemism in the Amazon. Almost 80 % of the total area of the BEA presents a strong anthropization of natural ecosystems. Of the 20 % of the area with high conservation value remnants, only 25 % is within protected areas, whereas the other 75 % is under private property domains. Moreover, forest remnants on private properties have a higher biodiversity conservation value as they are home to more threatened bird species than remnants within protected areas. Therefore, we argue that effective implementation of conservation of threatened bird species in the BEA depends directly on the maintenance of forest remnants on private properties from practical conservation actions.",

      "abstract": "The Pleistocene Coropina Formation largely constitutes the Old Coastal Plain of Suriname. It is exposed fully only in open-pit bauxite mines in the central coastal plain as part of the unconsolidated overburden of Paleocene–Eocene bauxites. This study deals with the stratigraphy, sedimentology and chronology of this formation, and is based on a study in the recently closed Lelydorp-III bauxite mine operated by N.V. BHP Billiton Maatschappij Suriname. The Coropina Formation consists of the Para and Lelydorp Members. We present a detailed lithological subdivision of these members. In the Para Member, four units are discerned which are grouped in two transgressive cycles, both ranging upward from terrestrial towards chenier and coastal mudflat deposits reflecting glacio-eustatic sea-level changes. The sandy sediments represent fluviatile and beach-bar (chenier) deposits, and were supplied by rivers from the Precambrian basement and to a lesser extent by westward longshore coastal drift. Clays, largely derived from the Amazon River and transported alongshore over the shelf, were deposited in extensive coastal mudflats. The Lelydorp Member, also comprising four units, represents a depositional system that is closely comparable to the recent Suriname coastal setting, i.e., a lateral and vertical alternation of mudflat and chenier deposits formed over a period characterised by more or less constant sea level. Palaeomagnetic data indicate a dominantly reversed magnetic polarity in the Para Member, whereas the Lelydorp Member shows a normal magnetic polarity with a minor reversed polarity overprint. The reversed polarities of the Para Member exclude a Brunhes Chron (0.78–0.0 Ma) age, and thus assign it to the Matuyama Chron (2.58–0.78 Ma). This implies that the Coropina Formation is much older than hitherto assumed, and that one or more (long-term) hiatuses are not recognizable in the lithological succession.",

      "abstract": "New research presented in this special issue of Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution on the “Phylogeny and Biogeography of Neotropical Primates” greatly improves our understanding of the evolutionary history of the New World monkeys and provides insights into the multiple platyrrhine radiations, diversifications, extinctions, and recolonizations that have taken place over time and over space in the Neotropics. Here, we synthesize genetic and biogeographic research from the past several years to construct an overarching hypothesis for platyrrhine evolution. We also highlight continuing controversies in Neotropical primate biogeography, such as whether the location of origin of platyrrhines was Africa or Asia; whether Patagonian fossil primates are stem or crown platyrrhines; and whether cis- and trans-Andean Neotropical primates were subject to vicariance through Andes mountain building, or instead diversified through isolation in mountain valleys after skirting around the Andes on the northwestern coast of South America. We also consider the role of the Amazon River and its major tributaries in shaping platyrrhine biodiversity, and how and when primates from the Amazon reached the Atlantic Forest. A key focus is on primate colonizations and extirpations in Central America, the Andes, and the seasonally dry tropical forests and savannas (such as the Llanos, Caatinga, and Cerrado habitats), all ecosystems that have been understudied up until now for primates. We suggest that most primates currently inhabiting drier open habitats are relatively recent arrivals, having expanded from rainforest habitats in the Pleistocene. We point to the Pitheciidae as the taxonomic group most in need of further phylogenetic and biogeographic research. Additionally, genomic studies on the Platyrrhini are deeply needed and are expected to bring new surprises and insights to the field of Neotropical primate biogeography.",

      "abstract": "Objectives\nYellow fever virus historically was a frequent threat to American and European coasts. Medical milestones such as the discovery of mosquitoes as vectors and subsequently an effective vaccine significantly reduced its incidence, in spite of which, thousands of cases of this deathly disease still occur regularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and the Amazonian basin in South America, which are usually not reported. An urban outbreak in Angola, consecutive years of increasing incidence near major Brazilian cities, and imported cases in China, South America and Europe, have brought this virus back to the global spotlight. The aim of this article is to underline that the preventive YFV measures, such as vaccination, need to be carefully revised in order to minimize the risks of new YFV outbreaks, especially in urban or immunologically vulnerable places. Furthermore, this article highlights the diverse factors that have favored the spread of other Aedes spp.-associated arboviral diseases like Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika, to northern latitudes causing epidemics in the United States and Europe, emphasizing the possibility that YFV might follow the path of these viruses unless enhanced surveillance and efficient control systems are urgently initiated.",

      "abstract": "The threat of man-induced global change on the nations of the wider Caribbean region varies from place to place because of differences in exposure to storms, differences in local tectonics and subsidence, and variations in land-use practices. Because of the large number of nations involved, many having only subsistence budgets, and the cost of deriving independently a comprehensive response to global change, the similarities and differences between national settings must be identified soon. These comparisons will form the basis for local response strategies; the common elements between nations provide a basis for responses similar to those other nations, whereas the differences mandate local adaptation. That the Caribbean will be impacted by climate change is certain: its environment, land uses, and economies are dictated in large part by this marine influence. Accompanying global change will be changes in sea level, differences in storm climate, and altered precipitation patterns; science cannot define today what form these changes will take. Because global change is inevitable—although its magnitude, timing, and geographic distribution are unknown—the wider Caribbean should begin the appropriate research and planning studies to set forth a response to global change, for implementation when scientific evidence for global change is more quantitative.",

Our civilization will continue to face the emergence of new pathogens and viruses: viruses will continue to evolve and adapt to new environments at a high rate; our population continues to grow through birth rate, land development, and migration; climate change will continue to increase the vector burden and spread and change the migratory pattern of animals; and our societal mobility will continue to increase through rapid transportation. The clinical evaluation of the febrile patient with a potential emerging viral pathogen involves documenting the likelihood for an infection by a detailed travel history, calculation of an incubation time by exposure, and an understanding of the disease progression though the clinical illness, which drives the differential diagnosis and the type of diagnostics ordered. Ultimately, the proper identification and diagnosis of a patient with a viral febrile illness due to an emerging pathogen will elicit the appropriate precautions to protect health care providers and communities, deliver appropriate therapeutic interventions, and initiate a targeted public health response.",

      "abstract": "Mangrove-mud coasts across the world erode because of uninformed management, conversion of mangrove forests into aquaculture ponds, development of infrastructure and urbanization, and/or extraction of groundwater inducing land subsidence. The accompanied loss of ecosystem values, amongst which safety against flooding, has far reaching consequences for coastal communities, exacerbated by sea-level rise. To halt erosion various nature-based solutions have been implemented as an alternative to hard infrastructure sea defenses, including mangrove planting and erection of low-tech structures such as bamboo fences, permeable brushwood dams, etc. These structures have been designed on the basis of best-engineering practice, lacking sufficient scientific background. This paper investigates the use and success of permeable dams over a period of about 15 years, describing their application in Guyana, Indonesia, Suriname, Thailand and Vietnam, summarizing the lessons-learned, and analyzing their functioning in relation to the physical-biological coastal system. Also an overview of relevant costs is given. The basic philosophy behind the construction of permeable dams is the rehabilitation of mangrove habitat through re-establishment of the (fine) sediment dynamics – we refer to Building with Nature as the overarching principle of this approach. Our main conclusions are that a successful functioning of permeable dams requires (1) a thorough understanding of the physical-biological system and analysis of the relevant processes, (2) patience and persistence, including maintenance, as the natural time scales to rehabilitate mangrove green belts take years to decades, and (3) intensive stakeholder involvement. We give a list of conditions under which permeable dams may be successful, but in qualitative terms, as local site conditions largely govern their success or failure.",

      "abstract": "Because many biological processes related to the dynamics of infectious diseases are caused by complex interactions between the environment, the host(s) and the agent(s), the necessity to address the methodological implications of this inherent complexity has recently emerged in epidemiology. Most epidemiologists now acknowledge that most human infectious diseases are likely to have complex dynamics. However, this knowledge still percolates with difficulty in their statistical “modus operandi”. Indeed, for the study of complex systems, the traditional first-line statistical toolbox of epidemiologists (mainly built around the Generalized Linear Model family), despite its undeniable practicality and robustness, has structural limitations deprecating its usefulness. Three major sources of complexity neglected or not taken into account by this first-line statistical toolbox and having deep statistical implications are the multi-level organization of data, the non-linear relationships between variables and the complex interactions between variables. Three promising candidates to incorporate along with traditional tools for a new first-line statistical toolbox more suitable to apprehend these sources of complexity are the generalized linear mixed models, the generalized additive models, and the structural equation models. The aforementioned methodologies have the advantage to be generalizations of GLM models and are relatively easy to implement. Their assimilation and implementation would thus be greatly facilitated for epidemiologists. More globally, this text underlines that an improved use of other methods as such described here compared to traditional ones has to be performed to better understand the complexity challenging epidemiologists every day. This is particularly true in the field of infectious diseases for which major public health challenges will have to be addressed in the coming decades.",

For sea turtles (a species displaying temperature sex determination) nesting throughout the tropics and subtropics, rainfall has previously been shown to influence the development environment of clutches; in its extreme resulting in high levels of egg or hatchling mortality. Yet when compared to other abiotic variables affecting clutch success, rainfall has received relatively little attention. We therefore examined how fluctuations in local rainfall at a tropical nesting site for leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) affected the nest environment. Temperature data loggers placed within clutches (n=8) revealed that protracted rainfall had a marked cooling effect on nests, so that seasonally improbable male-producing temperatures (<29.75 °C) were produced. We use these data to explore how rainfall may ultimately influence the sex ratios of sea turtle hatchlings both within and between nesting seasons, and discuss the importance of robust estimates of rainfall for future demographic models.",

      "abstract": "The need to reconcile food production, ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation has spurred the search for more sustainable ways of farming. Archaeology offers examples of prehistoric pathways to agricultural intensification that could be rich sources of inspiration for applying ecological engineering in agriculture today. We examine one set of techniques, pre-Columbian raised-field agriculture in wetlands of Mesoamerica and South America. We point to gaps in knowledge at three levels. First, raised-field agriculture was conducted in a wide range of soils and climates. How different systems functioned was likely to have been correspondingly diverse, but this variation is under-appreciated. At the scale of single farms, nutrient dynamics in raised-field systems likely included complexities quite unusual in ‘modern’ agriculture, owing to the mixture of aerobic and waterlogged compartments, but data are scarce. Second, at the landscape level there is disagreement about whether fallow periods were necessary, and their eventual roles are poorly understood. Current evidence suggests that self-organizing processes in fallows may have increased the sustainability of some raised-field farming systems in unusual ways. Third, the labor-intensive nature of raised-field farming is held to limit its pertinence to today's global problems, but its real labor costs are unknown. Furthermore, achieving sustainable intensive agriculture will require compensating farmers for ecosystem services they provide. Under a socioeconomic regime that does this, raised-field agriculture could have considerable practical application.",

While weathering and soils are of interest to a broad range of sciences, their role in geomorphology is specific and important. Weathering is the precursor to both chemical and mechanical erosion—denudation, thus important to the generation of sediments carried by other surface processes. Weathering is essential to the creation of soils. Weathering in all the cases is relevant to erosional and depositional landforms. However, specific in this volume are the landforms and landform processes dominated by weathering.",

      "abstract": "The skillful prediction of soil moisture can provide much help for many practical applications including ecosystem management and precision agriculture. It presents great challenges because the future variation of soil moisture has much uncertainty. Therefore, a novel encoder-decoder deep learning model with residual learning based on Long Short-Term Memory (EDT-LSTM) is developed in this study as an alternative data-intelligence tool. This model includes two layers: the encoder-decoder LSTM layer and LSTM with a fully connected layer, which is used to enhance the prediction ability by considering the intermediate time-series data between the input time step and the predictive time step. We tested EDT-LSTM for soil moisture prediction at the lead time of 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 days by using data from FLUXNET sites. The result shows that the improvements brought by EDT-LSTM were about 7.95% (1 day), 10.10% (3 days), 12.68% (5 days), 15.49% (7 days) and 19.71% (10 days) in average according to the R2 taking LSTM as the baseline. Furthermore, the predictability of soil moisture over various conditions (i.e., different hyper-parameters in EDT-LSTM, different predictive models, different climate regions and different sites) has been widely discussed for the understanding of models’ behavior in this paper. The proposed EDT-LSTM offered a new tool to predict soil moisture better. The code of EDT-LSTM is publicly available at https://github.com/ljz1228/CLM-LSTM-soil-moisture-prediction.",

      "abstract": "Logging is a pervasive disturbance, which often causes extensive destruction of forest community structure and severely impacts biodiversity in tropical regions. Previous work on the effects of anthropogenic activities on biodiversity have concentrated on taxonomic diversity. However, the effects of disturbances such as logging on the functional composition of communities (and thereby, ecosystem function) are poorly understood. Here, we examined variation in the functional traits and assembly processes of tropical montane rain forest communities along a gradient of logging intensity (clear-cut, selective logging, and old-growth) at three spatial scales (100 m2, 400 m2, and 2500 m2) in China. We measured six functional traits of species, including specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf chlorophyll (LChl), leaf nitrogen content (LNC), leaf phosphorus content (LPC), and wood density (WD) in each forest plot. Functional composition changed along the disturbance gradient from logged to old-growth forests. Species with resource-acquisitive strategies (high SLA, LNC, and LPC) dominated the clear-cut forest. In contrast, species with resource-conservative strategies (high LDMC, LChl, and WD) dominated the old-growth forest, while species in the selectively-logged forest showed intermediate values. Across forests with different logging intensities, environmental filtering appeared to be the key process governing community assembly. Spatial scale had a significant effect on functional diversity and community assemblage but did not affect functional traits at the community level. At larger spatial scales, the functional richness and functional dispersion of the three forest types all increased and different community assembly processes were more obvious. Logged forests still need more time to recover levels of functional diversity observed in old-growth forest. Selective logging maintained more functional diversity than clear-cutting in these tropical montane rain forests.",

      "abstract": "Natural ecosystem change over time is an often unconsidered issue for PES and REDD+ schemes, and a lack of consideration of thermodynamic limitations has led to misconceptions and oversimplifications regarding ecosystem services, especially for tropical mangrove forests. Mangroves are non-linear, non-equilibrium systems uniquely adapted to a highly dynamic boundary where shorelines are continually evolving and sea-level ever changing, and rarely conform to classical concepts of forest development and succession. Not all mangroves accumulate carbon and rates of forest floor accretion are directly linked to the frequency of tidal inundation. Carbon payments in either a PES or REDD+ scheme are dependent on the rate of carbon sequestration, not the size of C stocks, so site selection must be ordinarily confined to the sea edge. Gas emissions and net ecosystem production (NEP) are linked to forest age, particularly for monospecific plantations. Planting of mixed-species forests is recommended to maximize biodiversity, food web connectivity and NEP. Old-growth forests are the prime ecosystems for carbon sequestration, and policy must give priority to schemes to maintain their existence. Large uncertainties exist in carbon sequestration potential of mangroves, and such limitations must be factored into the design, timeframe and execution of PES and REDD+ schemes.",

Here I evaluate whether it is appropriate to use species lists derived from modeled range maps in macroecological studies. I compared species lists derived from about 90,000 range maps in the Botanical Information and Ecology Network (BIEN) for over 180 geographic regions (12 broad regions covering the whole of the New World; 172 smaller regions, i.e. Taxonomic Databases Working Group units) with those representing complete or nearly complete species lists obtained from the literature for the regions. I determined the completeness of native species composition and proportion of false presences and exotic (non-native) species in species lists derived from range maps in BIEN. I determined whether errors in species lists derived from modeled range maps affect macroecological inferences by comparing the relationships of α- and β-diversity with geographic and climatic variables between different datasets (i.e. species lists derived from range maps versus complete or nearly complete species lists derived from the literature). The completeness for native species lists derived from range maps was 60–74%, depending on spatial scale. On average, 65% of the species in a species list derived from BIEN for a geographic area are false presences or non-native species to the area. The relationships of α- and β-diversity derived from the BIEN dataset with geographic and climatic variables differ significantly from those derived from complete species lists. This study shows that the results of a macroecological study based on species lists derived from modeled range maps may be substantially incorrect due to high percentages of missing native species, and high numbers of non-native species and false presences. Thus, it may not be appropriate to use species lists derived from modeled range maps in the macroecological studies that require complete or nearly complete species lists.",

      "abstract": "In 2006, the Brazilian Forest Service (SFB) started an ambitious program to establish forest concessions so as to provide a legal framework for long-term sustainable timber production in Amazonian forests. Forest concessions in the Brazilian Amazon currently cover only 1.6 million ha (Mha) but we estimate the area of all potential concessions as 35 Mha. This paper assessed the conditions under which the present and potential concession system can ensure an annual production of 11 Mm3. yr−1 to meet the estimated present timber demand. For this we used the volume dynamics with differential equations model (VDDE) calibrated for the Amazon Basin with a Bayesian framework with data from 3500 ha of forest plots monitored for as long as 30 years after selective logging. Predictions of commercial volume recovery rates vary with location. We tested 27 different scenarios by using combinations of initial proportion of commercial volume, logging intensity and cutting cycle length. These scenarios were then applied to the current area of concessions and to the area of all potential concessions (35 Mha). Under current logging regulations and the current concession area (mean logging intensity of 15–20 m3.ha−1, a harvest cycle of 35 years and an initial commercial timber volume proportion of 20%), timber production can be maintained only for a single cutting cycle (35 years). Only the scenario with a logging intensity of 10 m3ha−1 every 60 years with a 90% initial proportion of commercial timber species can be considered as sustainable. Under this scenario, the maximum annual production with the present concession areas is 159,000 m3 (157–159), or less than 2% of the present annual production of 11 Mm3. When considering all potential concession areas (35 Mha), under current rules, the total annual production is 10 Mm3yr−1 (2–17 Mm3yr−1, 95% credibility interval) but is not maintained after the first logging cycle. Under the most sustainable scenario (see above) and a concession area of 35 Mha, the long-term sustainable annual production of timber reaches only 3.4 Mm3yr−1. Based on these results we argue that the concession system will not be able to supply the timber demand without substantial reforms in natural forest management practices and in the wood industry sector. We argue that alternative sources of timber, including plantations linked with forest restoration initiatives, must be promoted.",

      "abstract": "South America possesses distinctive and diverse river basins that are integral to the continent's natural, cultural, and socioeconomic identities. The geomorphologic and hydrological features of South American river systems are linked to the continent's unique tectonic and geographic settings. High rainfall rates across large interior basins make the Amazon, Orinoco, and Paraná Rivers three of the six highest discharge rivers in the world. Relatively small coastal rivers drain the Guyanas, much of the Atlantic Coast of Brazil, and the entire Pacific margin of the Andes. To the extreme south of the continent, temperate rivers drain the Argentine pampas and Patagonia Steppe. The diverse geographic and climatic settings of South American River Basins produce correspondingly diverse assemblages of riverine habitats and species. Rivers are integral to the welfare and development potential of South America's population, providing services ranging from water supply to important inland fisheries and hydroelectricity. Human pressures on the continent's river systems have lead to widespread contamination, disruption of natural flow regimes, land-cover conversion, and overexploitation of riverine resources. Improved river resource management and sustainable development are inextricably linked in South America.",

      "abstract": "The accurate and consistent identification of fossil pollen is essential to allow robust inferences to be drawn with regard to past vegetation and climate change. Identifications are best achieved through the direct inspection of reference material. Most substantial reference collections are located at research institutions in Europe or North America, which restricts access for researchers trying to advance palynology in less developed countries. Due to the development of digital imaging and fast internet access it is now possible to produce high quality images from pollen and spore reference collections and make them globally available. In this pollen and spore atlas we contribute to this growing body of work by presenting images of 240 pollen types (in 202 genera and ∼79 families) and 30 spore types (in 25 genera and ∼17 families) from a wide range of different vegetation types originating from the Kilimanjaro area and tropical East Africa. We provide an overview on the range of pollen and spore types commonly found in Last Glacial and Holocene sedimentary archives in studies from the Kilimanjaro area and tropical East Africa. Besides a pollen key, detailed information is given on pollination, habitus and habitat which all support the interpretation and environmental reconstructions from pollen records. The atlas will serve as useful guide for palynological investigations, aiming at detailed and comprehensive reconstruction of past vegetation, environmental and climate change in tropical East Africa.",

      "abstract": "Forests worldwide are threatened by various environmental and anthropogenic hazards, especially tropical forests. Knowledge on the impacts of these hazards on forest structure and dynamics has been compiled in empirical studies. However, the results of these studies are often not sufficient for long-term projections and extrapolations to large spatial scales especially for unprecedented environmental conditions, which require both the identification and understanding of key underlying processes. Forest models bridge this gap by incorporating multiple ecological processes in a dynamic framework (i.e. including a realistic model structure) and addressing the complexity of forest ecosystems. Here, we describe the evolution of the individual-based and process-based forest gap model FORMIND and its application to tropical forests. At its core, the model includes physiological processes on tree level (photosynthesis, respiration, tree growth, mortality, regeneration, competition). During the past two decades, FORMIND has been used to address various scientific questions arising from different forest types by continuously extending the model structure. The model applications thus provided understanding in three main aspects: (1) the grouping of single tree species into plant functional types is a successful approach to reduce complexity in vegetation models, (2) structural realism was necessary to analyze impacts of natural and anthropogenic disturbances such as logging, fragmentation, or drought, and (3) complex ecological processes such as carbon fluxes in tropical forests – starting from the individual tree level up to the entire forest ecosystem – can be explored as a function of forest structure, species composition and disturbance regime. Overall, this review shows how the evolution of long-term modelling projects not only provides scientific understanding of forest ecosystems, but also provides benefits for ecological theory and empirical study design.",

      "abstract": "Riverine forests in the Brazilian Amazon provide a series of ecosystem services and harbor one of the world's most diverse floras, but the main drivers of variation in small spatial scales in such tropical forests are not well understood. Our aim was to evaluate tree community structure and diversity patterns in the Teles Pires River to identify the main drivers of small-scale variations in the area. We sampled 4,180 individuals from 49 botanical families, 164 genera and 347 species by using six transects of five pairs of 50 m x 40 m permanent plots totalizing 60 permanent plots in a 12-hectare area. We utilized generalized linear mixed models to assess whether the effects of the environmental variables in the vegetation structural parameters. Altitude and groundwater depth were the main drivers influencing species diversity patterns. The trees had similar total biomass in areas within the same distance from the river margins. There was a lower species richness and tree density closer to the river margins. Otherwise, we found larger trees (higher individual biomass) closer to the river margins when compared to areas distant from the margins. Our results indicate a high species turnover from the river margins to the forest interior, which highlights the importance of assessing local effects on biological communities in tropical forests, especially in the Brazilian Amazon where several high-impact dams are planned.",

      "abstract": "Over-exploited fresh water resources, fossil-fuel depletion and climate change all highlight need for desalination powered by renewable energy. This study briefly reviews literature on solar desalination technologies and examines economic and environmental feasibility. The maturest technology appears to be reverse osmosis driven by photovoltaics. Many studies refer to apparent spatial coincidences of water scarcity, solar energy abundance and saline water availability, but none examine the phenomenon objectively from a global perspective. This study proposes a method for correlating international data on water scarcity and stress, saline water resources, and insolation levels, to calculate rank scores (0 ≤ R ≤ 1) which identify where solar desalination is most applicable. Low scores (R < 0.125) occur in landlocked nations with limited saline groundwater resources (Nepal, Bolivia, South Sudan) and near polar regions where fresh water is abundant and solar insolation levels are low (Canada, Russia and Scandinavia). High scores (R > 0.422) occur in 30 nations, including Middle Eastern and North African countries where fossil fuelled desalination is commonplace, and solar desalination has obvious applicability. The analysis identifies 28 further countries (including parts of USA, China, India, Indonesia, Australia, and countries throughout Africa, Asia, South America and Europe) where 0.273 < R < 0.422 scores indicate that other, less obvious, solar desalination opportunities exist.",

      "abstract": "Data on the distribution of triatomine species are usually obtained from the detection of peridomestic/domestic colonies, focal sampling of sylvatic populations, and information on the domestic intrusion of wild adult forms. Consequently, the more the synanthropic process of a Chagas disease vector is advanced, the more its geographic range may be precisely known. Thus, the past and recent changes in the geographic range of the most efficient vectors of T. cruzi to humans are well-known. However, an incomplete knowledge of species distribution exists when these organisms are restricted to sylvatic environments. It is unfeasible to systematically sample over wide areas because it is difficult to access certain types of ecotopes, thus making it difficult to investigate these areas. Moreover, in the case of exclusively sylvatic species, the sampling is generally random and, consequently, often unproductive. Finally, the sampled subsets are considered isolated species when they may represent components of an unknown continuous population. This chapter presents a review of the geographic distribution of Triatominae considering the species of epidemiological importance or the groups of species in which at least one species has an epidemiological significance as a vector of Trypanosoma cruzi to humans. All the species considered belong to the tribes Rhodniini and Triatomini.",

      "abstract": "Peat is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation. It is used mainly for two different purposes—horticulture and energy. Large areas of peatlands have been degraded in many countries around the world, but it is estimated that about 80% of the world's peatlands are still in their natural state. A real threat to the use of peat in the energy sector is constituted by carbon trading. Strong objections have been voiced to the industrial utilization of peatlands and many campaigns were organized in the 1990s to stop peat harvesting. If national solutions, such as taxation, are not used to balance the situation, calculated emissions from peat combustion based on the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) system are likely to lead to a very high cost of power and heat production from peat. Depending on the price of CO2 emissions in the carbon trade, it is estimated that the use of peat as fuel might, in the worst case, fall to one-third of the present level.",

      "abstract": "Safeguarding food security is one of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. When food production reaches its technological peak, a shortage of arable land will be the key factor that limits food production. Thus, how to increase the area of arable land without ecological damage is a problem faced by the whole world. China is the world's most populous country and a traditional agricultural country. Under the pressure of rapid socioeconomic development, China has taken measures to protect its cultivated land from environmental degradation and protect its food security. By reviewing the research literature, we found several ways to increase the area of arable land while protecting this land from damage. We found that natural resources such as marginal and degraded lands could potentially be converted into arable land while still protecting the ecological environment. However, implementation of such a strategy must account for each region's unique ecological and socioeconomic conditions, and will require both support from appropriate policies and ongoing monitoring and support.",

The fossil-bearing deposits, trapped within a depression in the Paleozoic basement, record three episodes of sedimentation formed on floodplains, with an intermediate unit recording a catastrophic deposition through debris flows, probably favored during fast floodings. The integrated approach presented herein supports a change in humidity in central Amazonia through the past 15,000 yr, with a shift from drier to arboreal savanna at 11,340 (±50) 14C yr B.P. and then to a dense forest like we see today at 4620 (±60) 14C yr B.P.",

      "abstract": "The processes initiating the first cooling step of the last greenhouse-to-icehouse transition, from 90 million years ago (Ma) onward still remain enigmatic. While the combination of mountain uplift and continental weathering has been proposed as a major sink for atmospheric CO2 and a climate driver over geological timescales, this hypothesis is much debated and its potential importance in triggering the late Cretaceous global cooling is yet to be explored. In this work, we combined clay mineralogy, trace and major element concentrations, and a new proxy of silicate weathering intensity based on Nd and Hf isotopes (∆ɛHf(t)clay) to explore the potential links between the uplift of the brazilian margin, silicate weathering and climate evolution during the late Cretaceous. Our new ∆ɛHf(t)clay proxy data suggest - for the first time - that marked increase of silicate weathering intensity occurred in southeast Brazil during the late Cretaceous, from ~85 to 70 Ma, related to the tectonic uplift affecting the eastern South American margin at that time. Combined with clay mineralogical analyses, our Hf-Nd isotope data further suggests the existence of a relatively arid local climate during the Turonian-Santonian interval, during which physical disaggregation of rocks most likely prevailed, accompanying the uplift of the Brazilian margin. From the Santonian, we propose that the exposure of new high-elevation regions favored instead locally enhanced precipitations and more hydrolysing conditions, thereby promoting chemical weathering and atmospheric CO2 drawdown. Altogether, our multi-proxy investigation suggests that the uplift of the Brazilian margin could have contributed to the late Cretaceous cooling, potentially playing a key role in the onset of the last greenhouse-to-icehouse transition.",

      "abstract": "The historical development of capitalism created what Karl Marx called a rift in the social metabolism with nature, whereby soil nutrients were systematically siphoned into cities where they were discarded as waste and thus did not return to the land. An alternative mode of food production known as agroecology was developed by different scientists and activists partly to transcend this contradiction. Drawing on data from the United Nations and the World Bank, this work analyzes whether agroecology has contributed to mitigate the metabolic rift in agriculture in Cuba, the country where this approach to food production, adopted after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, is more widely developed. By means of a panel model, both an internal comparison through time within Cuba and a cross-national comparison of Cuba with the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), were developed to determine whether the post-Soviet transition to agroecology in Cuba successfully decoupled industrial agricultural practices from productivity in comparison to other countries in LAC. Decoupling is understood as the removal of the positive correlation between fertilizer use and yield. Synthetic fertilizer use is utilized as an indicator of industrialized agriculture, and productivity of maize and beans as a proxy measure of soil improvement. The model shows a reversal of the fertilizer use and productivity positive correlation in Cuba, where crop productivity has increased while the use of inputs has diminished, which suggests that agroecology has indeed mitigated the metabolic rift produced by industrialized agriculture.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, I argue that the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) mechanism, a globally driven, market-based environmental policy, is racialized in practice. Yet, consideration of how the uptake of these policies is challenged by racialized relations is insufficiently addressed in the neoliberal conservation literature. Colonial histories are sedimented in racialized subjectivities and land management practices where certain economic activities, geographical sites and interactions with the natural environment became the stronghold of different groups. In this paper, I demonstrate how the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) mechanism, one such globally driven, market-based environmental policy, is challenged by the legacy of these racialized land use practices and social relations rooted in the defining colonial period in Guyana and Suriname. I outline the relationship between the processes of politically demarcating forests and of shaping subjectivities, drawing attention to how these processes are impacted by REDD+. Through a focus on gold mining, explored here as a historically conditioned, economic relationship with the natural environment, I show how REDD+ contributes to state territorialisation, complicates pre-existing racialized subjectivities and increases the legibility of forests and their amenability to state management.",

      "abstract": "Several assessments of vulnerability and resilience have been attempted at a country level through composite indices but they are barely in accord with a holistic view of sustainable development. We suggest graph theory to structure a network of variables that depict vulnerability and resilience from a sustainable development perspective. Vulnerability is defined as the propensity to incur adverse shocks whereas resilience is the capacity to cope with their negative effects. We identify two control dimensions of vulnerability–resilience (economic and political) and three contingency factors (the social, environmental and the peripheral dimensions). The specificity of the control dimensions is rooted in their impact on all other sides of the pentagon. We propose an algorithm to select the key variables useful in building a composite index that conforms to the structure of these five dimensions while preventing loss of information. An application is provided on Singapore, which has been specified as a typical case of resilience.",

      "abstract": "Blood-sucking insects are important vectors of disease, with biting Diptera (flies) alone transmitting diseases that cause an estimated 700 000 human deaths a year. Insect vectors also bite nonhuman hosts, linking them into host-biting networks. While the major vectors of prominent diseases, such as malaria, yellow fever, dengue, and Zika, are intensively studied, there has been limited focus on the wider interactions of biting insects with nonhuman hosts. Drawing on network analysis and visualisation approaches from food-web ecology, we discuss the value of a network perspective for understanding host–insect–disease interactions, with a focus on Diptera vectors. Potential applications include highlighting pathways of disease transmission, highlighting reservoirs of infection, and identifying emerging and previously unrecognised vectors.",

      "abstract": "The space industry generates pressures on the environment and strives towards more sustainable activities. Several actors of or related to the European space industry, such as ArianeGroup or and the European Space Agency (ESA), have identified the life cycle assessment methodology (LCA) as the most appropriate methodology to measure and then support the reduction of their environmental impact. While the use of the LCA is being established within the sector, only a limited number of peer-reviewed publications are available. Most of the documents released by the stakeholders can be considered to be grey literature. As the topic has not been properly discussed in the literature, there is an opportunity to bring the initiatives carried out by the space sector in recent years to the public domain. Thus, the present work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of past and present studies following the LCA framework. The review compiles 11 papers, conferences proceedings or technical reports that address the development of the LCA framework and good practices in the sector and 27 documents dedicated to LCA studies. On the one hand, the results highlight the emergence of a common framework regarding LCA practice in Europe. On the other hand, the analysed LCA case studies show a highly heterogeneous goal and scope definition. In this review, research needs and methodological challenges are identified and discussed. Finally, recommendations on how to implement and develop the use of LCA within the space industry are given in view of designing more sustainable space systems and associated missions.",

      "abstract": "The main goal of the present study was to test if two sympatric species of Heliconia, Heliconia spathocircinata and Heliconia laneana var. flava, differ in their reproductive seasons and guilds of flower visitors. Twenty-four sampling sessions were conducted monthly between February 2001 and January 2003. Individuals of H. spathocircinata and of H. laneana var. flava were tagged within a transect of 4000×4m. Reproductive phenophases (flowering, unripe, and ripe fruits) were recorded, and circular statistics were used to test for the regularity and frequency of phenophases. Flower visitors were observed during two flowering periods for each species. Both species had well-defined and synchronous reproductive periods, with a small overlap, suggesting a sequential flowering model. Biotic and abiotic factors seem to affect phenophases of both species. However, herbarium data suggest that the flowering period in H. spathocircinata varies less than in H. laneana, despite its wider geographic distribution. The hummingbird Phaethornis idaliae was the main floral visitor of both Heliconia species studied. H. laneana was also legitimately visited by another hummingbird species, Glaucis hirsuta, and by Lepidoptera. Some Lepidoptera, particularly the bee Trigona spinipes, were illegitimate visitors (‘nectar robbers’). We suggest that the flower of H. spathocircinata allowed a wider array of visitors, because it is bigger.",

      "abstract": "The notion of ‘food sovereignty’ is often surprisingly absent in food and agricultural discourses in the Anglo-Caribbean, where over the past half century policy-making has aligned with conventional ‘food security’ approaches. This paper argues that, in addition to its contemporary entrenchment within a neoliberal environment, this is also due to the nature of ‘sovereignty’ itself in a region which has been shaped by a distinctive colonial, social and economic history. In order to demonstrate this, firstly, it makes the case for why, in the context of rising food imports and enduring structural legacies, food sovereignty matters in the Anglo-Caribbean. Secondly, it charts changes in the regional policy of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) to show how, despite repeated calls to increase self-sufficiency, conventional neoliberal approaches to agricultural development and food security have predominated since the 1970s. Finally, it identifies and analyses limited instances where food sovereignty discourses have been mobilized, by farmers’ groups and political actors, and interrogates the meaning of both ‘internal’ and ‘external’ sovereignty itself in this post-colonial context. It finds mobilisations of food sovereignty to be characterised by a repeated conflation of domestic food production with the concept’s ideological principles as a political project, and a particular understanding of sovereignty that places an emphasis on ‘the state’ and ‘the region’ over ‘the people’. This shows that the very nature of ‘sovereignty’ itself plays a critical role in both the translation of, and possibilities for mobilising ‘food sovereignty’ as a radical project as envisaged in the wider literature.",

Here, we apply DNA sequences from multiple genes to infer the phylogeny of Empidini, focusing on placing the Neotropical lineages within the entire tribe and identifying monophyletic groups. We included 98 Empidini taxa along with 18 outgrous terminals, spanning the diversity within the group. The results from the analyses performed are largely similar, with major groupings of genera in common. Specifically, the analyses recovered a monophyletic Hilarini and a paraphyletic Empidini. Most species from Chile and Argentina (Andean region) are found to belong to an early branching lineage within Empidinae, and are not monophyletic with other Empidini. A large portion of the remaining Neotropical Empidini (not Andean) comprises a single clade that includes four endemic genera and a number of Neotropical Empis Linneaus species. Macrostomus and Porphyrochroa each recovered as monophyletic and sister to one another, although generic placement of a few taxa remains uncertain due to conflicting morphological features. Lamprempis+Opeatocerata are also found to be sister-taxa in most analyses. Several large genera were found to be polyphyletic or paraphyletic including Empis and Rhamphomyia Meigen. We evaluate our findings and discuss them in light of current Empidinae taxonomy.",

      "abstract": "The rapidly growing human population in West Africa has generated increasing demand for agricultural land and forest products. Consequently 90% of the original rainforest cover has now disappeared and the remainder is heavily fragmented and highly degraded. Although many studies have focused on carbon stocks and fluxes in intact African forests, little information exists on biomass recovery rates in secondary forests. We studied a chronosequence of 96 secondary and old-growth forest fragments (0.2 ha each) where 32.103 trees with Diameter at Breast Height >2.5 cm have been censused. We modelled the biomass recovery trajectories in a time-explicit Bayesian framework and tested the effect on recovery rates of a large set of covariates related to the physical environment, plot history, and forest connectivity. Recovery rate trajectory is highly non-linear: recovery rates accelerated from 1 to 37 years, when biomass recovery reached 4.23 Mg·ha−1·yr−1, and decelerated afterwards. We predict that, on average, 10%, 25% and 50% of the old-growth forest biomass is respectively recovered 17, 30, and 51 years after abandonment. Recovery rates are strongly shaped by both the number of remnant trees (residuals of the former old-growth forest) and the previous crop cultivated before abandonment. The latter induced large differences in the time needed to recover 50% of an old-growth forest biomass: from 38 years for former Yam fields up to 86 years for former rice fields. Our results emphasize (i) the very slow recovery rates of West African forests, as compared to Neotropical forests (ii) the long-lasting impacts of past human activities and management choices on ecosystem biomass recovery in West African degraded forests.",

      "abstract": "Damming has exerted far-reaching and profound impacts on ecological functions in river ecosystems. However, the “damming effects” on greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from tributaries of reservoirs in subtropical region were largely overlooked. In this study, we assessed the GHG fluxes (CH4, CO2 and N2O) from air–water interface and the related factors in Xiangxi River of Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) region over one year. The annual average fluxes of CH4, CO2 and N2O from Xiangxi River were 0.13±0.11mgm−2h−1, 16.01±23.21mgm−2h−1 and 21.57±12.75μgm−2h−1, respectively, which were significantly lower than those from tropical rivers or lakes. The GHG fluxes showed strong seasonal dynamics: CH4 was consistently released to the atmosphere and was more in summer than the other seasons. CO2 was absorbed from the atmosphere in spring, but was emitted the most in winter. N2O flux was higher in cold season than in warm season. Additionally, CH4 emission showed obvious spatial variations that decreased gradually from shallow to deep water-level areas. Correlation analysis demonstrated that CH4 emission was negatively correlated with water depth and air–water temperature difference, and positively with air temperature. CO2 flux was negatively related to chlorophyll a (Chl. a) and N2O flux was negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen (DO). The present study will deepen our understanding of Three Gorges Dam (TGD) construction impacts on GHG emissions in the tributaries, and help us to better estimate GHG emissions for TGR.",

Here, we describe epidemiological and diagnostic characteristics of all returning travellers diagnosed with leptospirosis in the Netherlands between 2009 and 2016. Furthermore, we present a detailed clinical case series of all travellers with leptospirosis who presented at the Academic Medical Center (AMC) in the same period.\nMethod\nWe extracted data from the records of the Dutch Leptospirosis Reference Center (NRL) of all cases of leptospirosis in travellers in the Netherlands from 2009 to 2016. Patients who presented at the AMC were identified and clinical data were extracted from the hospital records.\nResults\n224 cases of travel-related leptospirosis were included. An increase of cases was observed from 2014 onwards. The majority of cases were male (78.1%), and had travelled to South-East Asia (62.1%). Of 41 AMC cases, 53.7% were hospitalised, but most patients had a relatively mild disease course, with no fatalities. A longer delay in diagnosis and treatment initiation existed in hospitalised compared to non-hospitalised patients, suggesting a benefit of early recognition and treatment.\nConclusions\nLeptospirosis was increasingly observed in returning travellers in the Netherlands, and is a diagnosis that should be considered in any returning febrile traveller.",

Here, we studied the change in vegetation and the soil carbon stocks along the chronosequence of S. apetala plantations in Qi'ao Island, China. Five sites, including rehabilitated S. apetala of different ages (1, 4, 9, and 15 years) and 40-year-old mature native Kandelia obovata forests were investigated. Vegetation biomass and the soil carbon content from 0 to 100 cm were analyzed. The ecosystem carbon density (vegetation and soil) was then calculated. A positive and linear relationship was observed between the vegetation carbon stocks and age of S. apetala. The 15-year-old S. apetala already had a similar biomass to 40-year-old K. obovata. However, its soil and ecosystem carbon densities remained lower than those of K. obovata. Different from K. obovata, the majority of the biomass of S. apetala was reserved within the stem. Mature K. obovata had a larger proportion of soil carbon stock to ecosystem carbon stock. S. apetala can accumulate biomass rapidly, but it had a lower ecosystem carbon stock than the native mature K. obovata.",

      "abstract": "The vast tropical rainforest in Amazonia, once presumed a virgin wilderness vulnerable to climate forcing and inimical to indigenous cultures, is now shown by prehistoric, ethnographic, and ethnohistoric data to be almost the opposite: a human habitat resilient to environment change but much influenced by thousands of years of occupation. The earliest foragers quickly penetrated the region ca. 13,000 years cal BP, leaving traces far and wide. The first villages, ca. 4000 years cal BP later, created substantial shell-middens and disturbances in nearby forest areas. After another 4000 years cal BP in many regions, people turned to shifting horticulture, cutting and burning fields, disseminating crops, and planting trees. In the last 3000 years of prehistory, networks of populous, warring chiefdoms established nucleated centers along floodplains and trade routes, creating mound complexes, defense works, fields, orchards, and refuse heaps that greatly altered topography, soils, and vegetation. Some settlements grew to urban proportions during the last 1000 years of prehistory, leaving large earth mounds of rich black cultural refuse. Their effects altered habitats widely but not destructively in terms of resources for human use. European invaders defeated the chiefdoms, decimated their populations, and pushed survivors to the peripheries. Post-colonial states continued forced migration and deculturation and instituted destructive industries, destroying valuable timberlands, bulldozing orchards, shell mounds, anthropic forests, and archeological sites, polluting waters, and causing wide erosion and savannization. These changes threaten the integrity and continuity of the Amazon cultural ecological system and linked ecosystems beyond it.",

      "abstract": "The available palynological evidence allows reconstruction of the principal trends in the historical biogeography and evolution of the neotropical palm genus Mauritia. Its pollen is known from the Palaeocene, and has been widespread throughout the entire neotropical region, during the Tertiary. From the Late Miocene until the Pleistocene, populations have been progressively fragmented by the Andean orogeny, thus promoting local extinction in some smaller basins and allopatric speciation in others. During the Pleistocene, Mauritia survived the repeated dry and cool periods characteristic for glaciations either by restricting its distribution to assumed Amazon forest ‘refugia’ or by forming large-scale, heterogeneous forest communities. After the last glaciation, palynological studies document a broad dispersal process of Mauritia, leading to its present range. However, Holocene climatic shifts, together with human disturbance, created a heterogeneous distribution pattern with spatial and temporal differences within this process. Therefore, biogeographical inferences based on present-day observations can only account for the most recent changes and are not suitable for generalizations. The history of Mauritia derived from the fossil record suggests opportunities for both vicariance and allopatric speciation, and reveals dispersal patterns through time. The presence of Mauritia in sediments can also be used as a reliable indicator of warm tropical lowland environments flooded by fresh (occasionally oligohalyne) waters. Several hypothesis about its biogeographical history and its palaeoecological implications are offered that can be tested with future studies.",

      "abstract": "Vertical volume emission rate profiles of the OH(3–1) Meinel emission near the mesopause are retrieved from nighttime limb-emission observations with the SCIAMACHY (Scanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY) instrument on the Envisat satellite. Mean emission altitudes are determined by weighting altitude with the vertical OH(3–1) volume emission rate profile. Analysis of the SCIAMACHY data set from January 2003 to December 2011 shows a clear semi-annual variation of the mean emission altitudes at low latitudes – where SCIAMACHY performs measurements throughout the year – with an amplitude of 0.5–1.0km. Confirming earlier studies, we find a near constant, or universal, scaling of mean OH emission altitude and vertically integrated emission rate, which can be employed by ground-based observers to infer indirect information on OH emission altitude and its variability, if measurements of OH emission rates are performed. For this purpose we provide climatological fit parameters for the altitude/emission rate relationship. No obvious long-term trends or 11-year solar cycle signatures are present in the OH emission altitude time series, partly contradicting earlier studies. The long-term stability in OH emission altitude at the local time of the SCIAMACHY nighttime observations (10 p.m.) strengthens the use of ground-based OH rotational temperature measurements to study middle atmospheric climate change.",

      "abstract": "In neotropical regions, fossil bat guano accumulated over time as laminated layers in caves, hence providing a high-resolution temporal record of terrestrial environmental changes. Additionally, cave settings have the property to preserve such organic sediments from processes triggered by winds (deflation, abrasion and sandblasting) and intense rainfall (leaching away). This study reports both stable carbon and nitrogen isotope compositions of frugivorous bat guano deposited in a well-preserved stratigraphic succession of Blanchard Cave on Marie-Galante, Guadeloupe. These isotopic data are discussed with regard to climate changes and its specific impact on Eastern Caribbean vegetation during the Late Pleistocene from 40 to 10 ka cal. BP. Guano δ13C values are higher than modern ones, suggesting noticeable vegetation changes. This provides also evidence for overall drier environmental conditions during the Pleistocene compared to today. Meanwhile, within this generally drier climate, shifts between wetter and drier conditions can be observed. Large temporal amplitudes in both δ13C and δ15N variations reaching up to 5.9‰ and 16.8‰, respectively, also indicate these oceanic tropical environments have been highly sensitive to regional or global climatic forcing. Stable isotope compositions of bat guano deposited from 40 to 35 ka BP, the Last Glacial Maximum and the Younger-Dryas reveal relatively wet environmental conditions whereas, at least from the end of the Heinrich event 1 and the Bølling period the region experienced drier environmental conditions. Nevertheless, when considering uncertainties in the model age, the isotopic record of Blanchard Cave show relatively similar variations with known proxy records from the northern South America and Central America, suggesting thus that the Blanchard Cave record is a robust proxy of past ITCZ migration. Teleconnections through global atmospheric pattern suggest that islands of the eastern Caribbean Basin could be also under the influence of a bipolar temperature gradients that impact the mean location of the ITCZ, with a Southern Hemisphere imprint during the glacial period and a more significant role of Northern Hemisphere during the last deglaciation.",

      "abstract": "Large dams built for hydroelectric power generation alter the hydrology of rivers, attenuating the flood pulse downstream of the dam and impacting riparian and floodplain ecosystems. The present work mapped black-water floodplain forests (igapó) downstream of the Balbina Reservoir, which was created between 1983 and 1987 by damming the Uatumã River in the Central Amazon basin. We apply remote sensing methods to detect tree mortality resulting from hydrological changes, based on analysis of 56 ALOS/PALSAR synthetic aperture radar images acquired at different flood levels between 2006 and 2011. Our application of object-based image analysis (OBIA) methods and the random forests supervised classification algorithm yielded an overall accuracy of 87.2%. A total of 9800 km2 of igapó forests were mapped along the entire river downstream of the dam, but forest mortality was only observed below the first 49 km downstream, after the Morena rapids, along an 80-km river stretch. In total, 12% of the floodplain forest died within this stretch. We also detected that 29% of the remaining living igapó forest may be presently undergoing mortality. Furthermore, this large loss does not include the entirety of lost igapó forests downstream of the dam; areas which are now above current maximum flooding heights are no longer floodable and do not show on our mapping but will likely transition over time to upland forest species composition and dynamics, also characteristic of igapó loss. Our results show that floodplain forests are extremely sensitive to long-term downstream hydrological changes and disturbances resulting from the disruption of the natural flood pulse. Brazilian hydropower regulations should require that Amazon dam operations ensure the simulation of the natural flood-pulse, despite losses in energy production, to preserve the integrity of floodplain forest ecosystems and to mitigate impacts for the riverine populations.",

      "abstract": "A morpho-sedimentary analysis of the Ayeyarwady delta shoreline was conducted based on a field mission in Myanmar in November 2016 and interpretation of satellite images spanning the period 1974–2019. These analyses were complemented by data on land-to-water conversion and vice versa within a 2 km-wide coastal fringe, and on MERIS-derived seasonal and decadal-scale evolution of suspended particulate matter (SPM) off the delta. The objectives were to: (1) characterize the 450 km-long delta shoreline and coastal sediment transport pathways, (2) define the shoreline status (stability, erosion, accretion), and (3) identify potential causes of shoreline change and the future outcome of this status in terms of delta vulnerability. The delta shoreline was characterized on the basis of qualitative alongshore tidal, wave-energy, and sediment grain-size patterns (muddy, sandy or a mixture of both), and morphology (sandy beaches and mudflats). The deltaic coast exhibits a mixed wave-and-tide-dominated morphology and comprises a western sector characterized by four of the five main distributary mouths separating inter-distributary plains bounded by low overwash-influenced beaches devoid of aeolian dunes. The eastern sector, in the Gulf of Martaban, is embayed, much less prograded and bounded by dominantly muddy shores. This simple shoreline dichotomy reflects the overarching alongshore sediment redistribution and storage patterns that have accompanied the growth of the delta, resulting in the two facies: sand dominantly retained in the western sector where the multiple distributary mouths have constrained potential alongshore sand transport by low- to moderate-energy monsoon-generated southwesterly waves, and mud transported by the regional monsoon-influenced coastal shelf circulation towards the eastern sector. The recent multi-decadal shoreline mobility in the Ayeyarwady delta points to the influence of fluvial sediment supply on these two facies. Between 1974 and 2019, 49% of the delta's shoreline underwent erosion, mainly affecting the sandy beaches in the western sector, whereas shoreline accretion is still prevalent along the large inter-distributary plain east of Yangon, where coastal mud preferentially accumulates in the Gulf of Martaban. We attribute erosion to reduced river sand supply generated by dams and by massive in-channel sand mining upstream of the delta, exacerbated by important channel dredging. Large-scale deforestation resulting from land-use changes (agriculture and mining) in the Ayeyarwady catchment are probably contributing to enhanced fine-grained sediment supply to the delta plain and the coast, as reflected by the relative stability of coastal SPM over a decade (2002–2012) and continued deposition in the accreting eastern sheltered part of the delta. The coastal sediment balance will be further impacted in the future if planned dams are constructed. Without proper sediment management, notably a significant reduction or prohibition of in-channel sand mining, the sandy beaches that armour the wave-exposed western sector of the delta will continue to erode, resulting in increased potential exposure of the delta to cyclones and sea-level rise.",

      "abstract": "Insects, particularly ants, are good bioindicators of the state of ecosystems. Nevertheless, incorporating them into conservation surveys is expensive due to problems associated with their identification, which is exacerbated by the fact that there are fewer and fewer taxonomists working today. “Taxonomic sufficiency” (TS), which identifies organisms to a level of taxonomic resolution sufficient enough to satisfy the objectives of a study, has never been applied to Neotropical ant communities. We analysed five Neotropical datasets representing ant assemblages collected with different sampling methods in various habitats. We first treated them using two complementary and cumulative TS methods, higher-taxon and “indicator taxa” surrogacies, before testing a new approach called “mixed-level method” that combines the two previous approaches. For the higher-taxon surrogacy, we showed that, above species, genus is the most informative taxonomic level. Then, mixed-level method provided more information on ant assemblages than did the two others, even though the “indicator taxa” surrogacy was based on relevant indicator genera. Although habitat type has no effect on its efficiency, this new method is influenced by the dataset structure and the type of sampling method used to collect data. We have thus developed a new method for analyzing Neotropical ant faunas that enables the taxonomic work linked to the identification of problematic species to be significantly reduced, while conserving most of the information on the ant assemblage. This method should enhance the work of Neotropical entomologists not specialised in taxonomy, particularly those concerned with biological conservation and indication.",

      "abstract": "The present work deals with determination groundwater flows in the Amazon region, based on analysis of geothermal data acquired in shallow and deep wells. The method employed is based on the model of simultaneous heat transfer by conduction and advection in permeable media. Analysis of temperature data acquired in water wells indicates down flows of groundwaters with velocities in excess of 10−7m/s at depths less than 300m in the Amazonas basin. Bottom-hole temperature (BHT) data sets have been used in determining characteristics of fluid movements at larger depths in the basins of Acre, Solimões, Amazonas, Marajó and Barreirinhas. The results of model simulations point to down flow of groundwaters with velocities of the order of 10−8 to 10−9m/s, at depths of up to 4000m. No evidence has been found for up flow typical of discharge zones. The general conclusion compatible with such results is that large-scale groundwater recharge systems operate at both shallow and deep levels in all sedimentary basins of the Amazon region. However, the basement rock formations of the Amazon region are relatively impermeable and hence extensive down flow systems through the sedimentary strata are possible only in the presence of generalized lateral movement of groundwater in the basal parts of the sedimentary basins. The direction of this lateral flow, inferred from the basement topography and geological characteristics of the region, is from west to east, following roughly the course of surface drainage system of the Amazon River, with eventual discharge into the Atlantic Ocean. The estimated flow rate at the continental margin is 3287m3/s, with velocities of the order of 218m/year. It is possible that dynamic changes in the fluvial systems in the western parts of South American continent have been responsible for triggering alterations in the groundwater recharge systems and deep seated lateral flows in the Amazon region.",

      "abstract": "Protected areas (PAs) are dedicated and managed to achieve long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values. However, few studies have assessed contamination/pollution, one of the top five biodiversity threats, within these areas. In fact, more than 100,000 molecules used in consumer goods are potentially affecting over 250,000 protected areas distributed worldwide. As a result, chemical appraisal within PAs require specific approaches to be feasible. Herein, an approach for assessment of contamination in marine protected areas (MPAs) spread over large continental and/or global areas was proposed and tested using, as a case study, the impact of tributyltin (TBT) within Latin America. This approach included area delimitation, bibliographic survey, construction of attribute tables, data insertion in a Geographic Information System, overlapping with worldwide shapefiles of PAs, identification of affected PAs and evaluation of impacts using the outcomes against specific environmental quality guidelines/directives. A total of 259 records of TBT occurrence and/or its biological effect within 53 marine protected areas (including biosphere reserves, Ramsar sites and National parks) were gathered. Among affected species, were recorded 18 gastropods exhibiting imposex. In addition, 6 bivalves, 1 crustacean, and 3 fish species presenting TBT residues in tissues were seen in MPAs from Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, Chile and Venezuela. Since levels of TBT recorded in several studied MPAs were enough do induce deleterious biological responses over marine biota, it was clear that conservancy goals of some “protected” areas are under threat. Considering that only TBT exposure was appraised, and these areas are likely to be concomitantly exposed to other classes of contaminants, the actual scenario can be even more frightening. Although initially applied as a TBT case study, the present approach enables an overview for other chemicals within protected areas worldwide.",

      "abstract": "Data collected from hydrographic stations occupied within the Venezuelan and Columbian basins of the Caribbean Sea from 1922 through 2003 are analyzed to study the decadal variability of deep temperature in the region. The analysis focuses on waters below the 1815-m sill depth of the Anegada–Jungfern Passage. Relatively dense waters (compared to those in the deep Caribbean) from the North Atlantic spill over this sill to ventilate the deep Caribbean Sea. Deep warming at a rate of over 0.01°Cdecade–1 below this sill depth appears to have commenced in the 1970s after a period of relatively constant deep Caribbean Sea temperatures extending at least as far back as the 1920s. Conductivity–temperature–depth station data from World Ocean Circulation Experiment Section A22 along 66°W taken in 1997 and again in 2003 provide an especially precise, albeit geographically limited, estimate of this warming over that 6-year period. They also suggest a small (0.001 PSS-78, about the size of expected measurement biases) deep freshening. The warming is about 10 times larger than the size of geothermal heating in the region, and is of the same magnitude as the average global upper-ocean heat uptake over a recent 50-year period. Together with the freshening, the warming contributes about 0.012mdecade–1 of sea level rise in portions of the Caribbean Sea with bottom depths around 5000m.",

      "abstract": "Tree growth and mortality are two central processes in mixed and structurally complex moist tropical forests, yet accurate estimates of the variables needed to model them remain sparse and scattered. It is thus still difficult to predict forest evolution at a local scale and build reliable management plans. To help fill this gap, for 1–7 years we annually monitored 21,180 trees belonging to 42 species exploited for timber production in Central Africa. We made new species-specific estimates of diameter increments and mortality rates, and investigated how tree growth varied with tree size and logging history. We compared our results with the legal values of diameter increments, mortality rates, and minimum cutting diameters used to build forest management plans in Cameroon. Diameter increment was found to vary with tree size for most of the species studied. The relationships between diameter increment and tree size were mostly humpback-shaped. The trees with diameters close to or lower than the reference minimum cutting diameter generally grew faster than the average. We also found that tree growth could slow for 1–2 years after timber exploitation and was then spurred for at least 5 years. The tree growth response to logging was nevertheless species-specific. This study provides new estimates of tree diameter increments and mortality rates that could help make more accurate forest projections and draw up sustainable management plans in Africa.",

      "abstract": "To develop solar energy as a primary source of electricity supply in China, it is imperative to also develop an overall and complete solar energy potential analysis. Such an analysis technique would be a substantial contribution to solar power generation development both nationally and regionally. This study analyzes the spatial and temporal distribution of solar energy in China and estimates the solar energy potential from three aspects: geography, technology, and economy. The results of this research showed that the solar energy resource in China is substantially rich and stable, but also has notable spatial heterogeneity. A potential estimation indicated that Xinjiang Province was the most optimal site for large-scale photovoltaic station construction, displaying the highest values for all three potentials. It was also found that solar energy potential in western China is greater, while the eastern region is less suitable for solar photovoltaic development. These results can provide support for the large-scale development and utilization of solar energy resources in the future.",

Carboxylesterases (CEs) exhort several physiological roles, but also respond to pesticides. Searching for an AChE alternative, baseline CE activities were characterised in Ruditapes decussatus gills and digestive glands using five substrates suggestive of different isozymes. The long chain p-nitrophenyl butyrate and 1-naphthyl butyrate were the most sensitive. In the digestive gland, their kinetic parameters (Vmax and Km) and in vitro sensitivity to the organophosphorus metabolite chlorpyrifos oxon (CPX) were calculated. IC50 values, in the pM–nM range, suggest a high protection efficiency of CE-related enzymes towards CPX neurotoxicity. Other targeted enzymes were: activities of glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and lactate dehydrogenase in gills and digestive glands. The high GSTs activity and CE/AChE ratio suggests that R. decussatus has a great capacity for enduring pesticide exposure.",

      "abstract": "We inferred the phylogenetic relationships, divergence time and biogeography of Conopophagidae (gnateaters) based on sequence data of mitochondrial genes (ND2, ND3 and cytb) and nuclear introns (TGFB2 and G3PDH) from 45 tissue samples (43 Conopophaga and 2 Pittasoma) representing all currently recognized species of the family and the majority of subspecies. Phylogenetic relationships were estimated by maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. Divergence time estimates were obtained based on a Bayesian relaxed clock model. These chronograms were used to calculate diversification rates and reconstruct ancestral areas of the genus Conopophaga. The phylogenetic analyses support the reciprocal monophyly of the two genera, Conopophaga and Pittasoma. All species were monophyletic with the exception of C. lineata, as C. lineata cearae did not cluster with the other two C. lineata subspecies. Divergence time estimates for Conopophagidae suggested that diversification took place during the Neogene, and that the diversification rate within Conopophaga clade was highest in the late Miocene, followed by a slower diversification rate, suggesting a diversity-dependent pattern. Our analyses of the diversification of family Conopophagidae provided a scenario for evolution in Terra Firme forest across tropical South America. The spatio-temporal pattern suggests that Conopophaga originated in the Brazilian Shield and that a complex sequence of events possibly related to the Andean uplift and infilling of former sedimentation basins and erosion cycles shaped the current distribution and diversity of this genus.",

This incredibly diverse order includes members inhabiting every continent, either naturally or in human-made environments. While rodents have been the cause or implicated in disease transmission that has lead to human pandemics, such as the Black Death, and the decimation of certain animal species, like island-dwelling birds; genetically modified rodents have contributed significantly to the advancement of biomedical research and human health. There are more than 50 species of endangered rats, mice, voles, squirrels, and marmots. The recent extinction of the Bramble Cay melomys represents the first human-induced rodent extinction linked to climate change. Rodents are the reservoir host of several human and domestic pathogens of concern listed by OIE. Herein, we highlight those diseases of rodents that lead to clinically important gross and microscopic lesions.",

      "abstract": "Sea surface temperature (SST) can influence the phytoplankton biomass, measured as sea surface chlorophyll concentration (SSCC), by affecting the physical and chemical properties of the seawater, living environment, and the consumption of zooplankton in a complex way. Yet, the quantitative assessment of the spatiotemporal variation of the inherent synchronous association between SSCC and SST at large spatial and temporal scales is still lacking. Accordingly, in the present study a synthetic approach was proposed that combines wavelet coherency analysis (WCA) with Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) modeling and hotspot analysis in order to evaluate the association between SSCC and SST globally during the period July 2002-February 2019. The WCA-based statistical results showed that SSCC has strong association with SST; particularly strong synchronous variations between SSCC and SST were found at the 1-year and the 5-year periods. During the 1-year period, cluster characteristics were explored in the BME-generated space–time maps of the association strength as well as in the corresponding hotspot maps. Geographically, high association strengths between SSCC and SST were detected in the mid-latitude regions of the Pacific Ocean, in the south and north of the tropical regions of the Atlantic Ocean, and in the southern part of the Indian Ocean. Temporally, most of the sub-regions exhibited a stable level of association strength during the entire study period (only a few sub-regions exhibited fluctuations or a slightly decreasing association strength trend). In conclusion, by assimilating the available knowledge bases at each grid point the proposed synthetic approach assessed quantitatively the strength of the periodic association between SSCC and SST globally; and the approach could be employed to map the space–time variation of the association strength between related natural attributes in the space–time-frequency domain.",

      "abstract": "Rodents are the most diversified mammalian order (484 extant genera including 2277 species), and they have a worldwide distribution. Palaeontological, morphological and molecular data have greatly helped to resolve their systematics and evolutionary history. However, some discrepancies remain between palaeontologists and molecular biologists. New techniques in molecular biology, and especially in palaeogenetics, allow us to have direct access to the hereditary material of extinct organisms, and they can compensate for some morphological limits. Unfortunately, few studies are dealing with rodent palaeogenetics, despite the amount of museum and fossil material available. Here, we review the major research activities in rodent palaeogenetics (phylogeny, genetic diversity, migration), and we present the promising research perspectives in this field (phylochronology, palaeoparasitology).\nRésumé\nParmi les Mammifères, l’ordre des Rongeurs est de loin le mieux représenté (484 genres, comprenant 2277 espèces) à travers le monde. L’histoire évolutive et la systématique de ce groupe ont largement été étudiées par le biais de données paléontologiques, morphologiques et moléculaires. Cependant, il persiste certains points de désaccord entre paléontologistes et biologistes moléculaires. L’avancée des techniques de biologie moléculaire, et particulièrement en paléogénétique, permet désormais d’accéder au patrimoine génétique d’organismes disparus depuis plusieurs milliers d’années, mais aussi de pallier certaines limites de la morphologie. Malheureusement, peu de travaux se rapportant aux rongeurs intègrent des données paléogénétiques, malgré l’importante quantité de fossiles et de matériel conservés dans les musées. Nous présentons ici une synthèse des travaux effectués en paléogénétique (phylogénie, diversité génétique, migration) depuis l’origine de la discipline, ainsi que les champs disciplinaires prometteurs dans ce domaine (phylochronologie, paléoparasitologie).",

      "abstract": "Ecosystem services are the bridge between nature and society, and are essential elements of community well-being. The Wet Tropics Australia, is environmentally and biologically diverse, and supplies numerous ecosystem services. It contributes to the community well-being of this region, Australian national economy and global climate change mitigation efforts. However, the ecosystem services in the region have rarely been assessed undermining strategic landscape planning to sustain their future flow. In this study, we attempted to: (i) assess the quantity of five regulating ecosystem services – global climate regulation, air quality regulation, erosion regulation, nutrient regulation, and cyclone protection, and three provisioning ecosystem services – habitat provision, energy provision and timber provision across rainforests, sclerophyll forests and rehabilitated plantation forests; (ii) evaluate the variation of supply of those regulating and provisioning ecosystem services across environmental gradients, such as rainfall, temperature, and elevation; (iii) show the relationships among those ecosystem services; and (iv) identify the hotspots of single and multiple ecosystem services supply across the landscape. The results showed that rainforests possess a very high capacity to supply single and multiple ecosystem services, and the hotspots for most of the regulating and provisioning ecosystem services are found in upland rainforest followed by lowland rainforest, and upland sclerophyll forest. Elevation, rainfall and temperature gradients along with forest structure are the main determinant factors for the quantity of ecosystem services supplied across the three forest types. The correlation among ecosystem services may be positive or negative depending on the ecosystem service category and vegetation type. The rehabilitated plantation forests may provide some ecosystem services comparable to the rainforest. The results demonstrated disturbance regimes (such as tropical cyclones) may have influenced the usual spatial trend of ecosystem service values. This study will assist decision makers in incorporating ecosystem services into their natural resource management planning, and for practitioners to identify the areas with higher values of specific and multiple ecosystem services.",

      "abstract": "This work assessed the carbon storage and sequestration potential in the planted mangrove stands of Avicennia marina of different age groups (16–27.2 years), as influenced by vegetation and soil characteristics in an estuarine system of southeast coast of India. The carbon storage was 22-folds higher in soil and 56-folds greater in both tree biomass and soil in the mangrove stands than that in non-planted site. The carbon sequestration was 90-folds higher in soil and 9890-folds greater in both tree biomass and soil than that in control site. Hence, mangrove planting had an extraordinary potential for carbon sequestration in barren areas. The carbon sequestration and storage increased with increasing levels of silt, clay, moisture and nutrients (N, S, Cu, K, P, Fe, Zn, Mn, and Mg) in the mangrove soil. In contrast, the carbon sequestration and storage reduced with increasing levels of temperature, pore-water salinity, pH, bulk density and sand in the mangrove soil. This work calls for an attention on the mangrove stands of low carbon holding for remedial measures through soil management to improve the carbon storage and sequestration potential towards mitigating the global warming.",

      "abstract": "The statistical and probabilistic analyses of a database of Upper Cretaceous tropical dinoflagellate cysts from Venezuela allow us to recognize 21 species in the optimal stratigraphic sequence. Compilation of the dinoflagellate cysts reported in ten studies of Upper Cretaceous tropical localities from northern South America and the Gulf of Guinea allow the recognition of a rich assemblage (262 species), dominated by gonyaulacoid (129 spp), followed by protoperidinioid (82 spp), areoligeroid (29 spp), gymnodinioid (12 spp) and ceratioid (10 spp) taxa. Seventy-three species in the tropical database are reported in both regions, allowing the age calibration of the optimal sequence from Venezuela. The proposed final sequence of bioevents allows recognition of most stages in tropical Upper Cretaceous strata. The high diversity of the Spiniferites-Achomosphaera group and scarcity of Impagidinium indicates shallow marine depositional environments for most of the Upper Cretaceous tropical localities included. The dominance of gonyaulacoid species in the tropical database suggests that these were the dominant primary producers in the tropical Late Cretaceous oceans.",

      "abstract": "Forest structure and biomass production of Kandelia obovata Sheue, H.Y.Liu & J.Yong mangrove plantations in Northern Viet Nam were investigated for 1- to 20-year-old stands. The measurements were implemented over the study plots which were set up in 1-, 5-, 6-, 7-, 8-, 9-, 10-, 18-, 19- and 20-year-old K. obovata plantations. Tree density, stem diameter at 30 cm height (D0.3) and tree height (H) were measured. These parameters increased with stand age from young to mature stage with the ranges from 3,700 ± 1,609 tree.ha−1 to 26,500 ± 1,153 tree.ha−1, 0.67 ± 0.18 cm to 8.73 ± 3.16 cm, and 0.46 ± 0.16 m to 4.12 ± 0.96 m for density, stem diameter at 30 cm height and stem height, respectively. Fifty trees were harvested to find an allometric relationship between tree size and dry mass. Allocation models were developed to estimate above ground biomass. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), the root mean square error (RMSE), R2, and P-value of the models were calculated and compared to find the fitness models for biomass evaluation. The best correlation satisfied between D0.3*H and dry mass of tree components and total above ground biomass (AGB). Our results showed a rise in above ground biomass of 1- to 20-year-old K. obovata plantations, which ranges from 0.04 ± 0.02 Mg ha−1 to 115.39 ± 15.34 Mg ha−1. Of this, ~87% of the above ground biomass was represented by stems and branches. Above ground biomass and its components linearly increased with stand age. It was found that the biomass in the study area increased with an annual rate of 4.33 Mg ha−1 yr−1. These results provide a view of mangrove plantations in assessing the biomass of mangroves continuously from young to mature stages of reforestation.",

      "abstract": "Mangroves have long been associated with human populations, as coastal communities rely on the various ecosystem services that mangroves provide. However, human degradation and destruction of mangrove forests is common, despite and because of our reliance on them as valuable ecosystems. Mangrove research and management must elucidate and reconcile these conflicts to maintain mangrove forests and the services that humans depend on. To better understand the complex dynamics, interactions and relationships that exist between mangroves and coastal communities, the 5th Mangrove Macrobenthos and Management (MMM5) conference was held in Singapore in July 2019, with the theme “Mangroves and People: Impacts and Interactions”. This theme was chosen because Southeast Asia is the epicentre of ongoing mangrove loss, and a large number of coastal communities in the region rely on the ecosystem services that mangroves provide. The 32 papers published in this Special Issue represent the breadth of mangrove research presented at MMM5, including topics in faunal biology, ecosystem ecology, genetics, physical geography, biogeochemistry, remote sensing and the social sciences. The articles are characterized under the following topics: 1) mangrove ecosystem functioning; 2) range expansion of mangroves; 3) ecosystem services of mangroves; 4) anthropogenic and natural threats to mangroves; and 5) the management and social-ecology of mangroves. This Special Issue highlights the current state of the art of mangrove research and application, and describes a number of emerging new ideas and research opportunities that will continue to advance mangrove ecosystem science into the future.",

      "abstract": "Long term and high resolution data on water discharge, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and contaminant concentrations in rivers are required for a better understanding of particulate transfers from the continental areas to the seas. The aim of this study was to provide a novel estimation of annual fluxes of SPM and related pollutants in the Rhône River from Lake Geneva to the Mediterranean Sea by combining high frequency or time-integrative monitoring and novel relations between SPM concentration (Cs) and water discharge (Q). At six stations of the Rhône Sediment Observatory (OSR), SPM fluxes were calculated over the 2000–2016 period by combining observational data and Cs-Q relations. Monthly average concentrations of mercury (Hg) and PCB 180 were obtained by analysis of SPM samples collected in time integrative particle traps between 2011 and 2016. These pollutants were selected because of the well documented contamination of the Rhône watershed by these substances. Inter-annual fluxes at the Rhône River outlet averaged 6.6 Mt. yr−1 for SPM, 572 kg yr−1 for Hg and 14 kg yr−1 for PCB 180. The Isère and Durance tributaries were found to be the main contributors of SPM fluxes. Annual SPM budgets were not balanced, suggesting deposition, remobilization of bottom sediments and/or contributions from non-monitored tributaries. The SPM sampled at the outlet was more contaminated than the combined SPM inputs from the monitored tributaries, suggesting that intermediate sources of contamination were not captured in the budget.\nWe use first field-based observations of precipitation and river isotopic chemistry from a three-year study (2009–2011) in rainforest and nearby savannah in central Guyana at the northern rim of the Amazon rainforest to establish the quality of modelled or remotely-sensed datasets. Our 3 years of data capture a reduced rainfall regime in 2009 and an extended wet season in 2010, in contrast to the widely documented Amazonian floods in 2009 and droughts in 2010. Comparisons of observed precipitation with satellite derived TRMM and ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis precipitation show that both of these data sets capture the general pattern of seasonality, but substantially underestimate rainfall amounts in the primary wet season (by up to 50% and 72% respectively). The TRMM dataset is generally better at characterising the main dry season from September to December but the ERA-Interim model can overestimate precipitation in the dry season by up to 175%. Our new data on isotopic chemistry of river waters show that δ2H/δ18O values in this region are broadly consistent with interpolated global datasets of modelled precipitation isotopic signatures. The dominance of isotopically lighter water derived from the rains of the ITCZ during the wet season provides evidence of the close coupling of water chemistry of headwater rivers on the northern rim of Amazonia to the positioning of the ITCZ over the region. Our results highlight the challenge in understanding and representing local scale hydrological and biogeochemical characteristics using regional scale model data. We argue that combining point and local scale field data with larger scale model data is necessary to progress towards a comprehensive understanding of climate–hydrology interactions in Amazonia.\nThis paper presents an evolutionary model for a coastal barrier in the southernmost coastal sector of Brazil during the Holocene. The dataset is based on 15–20 m drill cores and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) records. The model barrier evolution has two main steps. The first step is the transgression of the barrier controlled by sea-level rise during the Postglacial Marine Transgression, which ended at approximately 6–5 cal ka. Radiocarbon dating indicates that the coastal plain began to be flooded by lagoonal waters between ∼10 and 6.7 cal ka. The second step comprises a barrier transgression controlled by a negative sediment budget of the beach system during the last 6–5 cal ka in a period of an overall slow sea-level fall of approximately 2 m. During the second step, the transgressive barrier migrated because of coastal erosion (the negative sediment budget) and the landward transference of sand by wind and lagoonal delta washout.\nDuring fieldwork carried out in January 2009 at Aurora do Tocantins (Tocantins State, northern Brazil), we recovered a fragmentary right maxilla (UNIRIO-PM 1006) of Catagonus stenocephalus from a sedimentary deposit of presumed late Pleistocene age in a karstic cave. This paper aims to: (1) provide the first record of C. stenocephalus in the northern region of Brazil (and consequently, also the northernmost one); (2) update the geographic distribution of C. stenocephalus; (3) present a date for the specimen; and (4) discuss the palaeoenvironmental and palaeobiogeographical implications of the finding. The species C. stenocephalus (Lund) is known from the Bonaerian (middle Pleistocene) and Lujanian (late Pleistocene to earliest Holocene) ages in Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil and Bolivia. The new record presented here extends the geographical distribution of C. stenocephalus more than 1000 km north from the former northernmost record (caves of Lagoa Santa region). Peccaries of the genus Catagonus have several morphological features associated with cursorial habits in relatively open and dry environments. The new distributional range of C. stenocephalus is coincident with the Chacoan subregion, characterized by dry climates and open areas. As the studied material comes from the top of the carbonate layer, this may suggest that the deposition of the C. stenocephalus remains described here is synchronous with the onset of a wetter climate phase. This argument is also in accordance with the datation results, around 20 ky BP, just after the last glacial maximum. This increasingly wet climate, which may also be related to the climatic changes that occurred during the late Pleistocene/early Holocene, could be a factor in the extinction of C. stenocephalus in South America.\nTwo sediment cores from Mauritia flexuosa palm swamps have been studied by pollen and charcoal analysis. The cores Fazenda Cigana (FC) and Terra Indígena Aningal (TIA) were taken from a savanna-forest ecotone area in the Roraima State, northern Brazilian Amazon. Based on 5 radiocarbon dates, these records allow the reconstruction of the vegetation fire and climate dynamics during the past 1550 years. At the FC site was recorded a higher proportion of forest cover, suggesting local wetter climatic conditions favorable for forest expansion, especially by gallery forests, between 1550 and 1400 cal yr BP. Stands of M. flexuosa started to establish on the site indicating sufficient soil moisture. From 1400 to 1050 cal yr BP, forest cover retreated while savanna, and the Mauritia palm swamp expanded considerably. The FC site was marked by savanna and Mauritia cover with a slight increase of forest between ca. 1050 and 900 cal yr BP. From 900 to 300 cal yr BP the savanna and palm swamp taxa became dominant and the forest area decreased. At the TIA site the savanna cover was dominant between 1200 and 1000 cal yr BP. From 1000 to 700 forest expanded while savanna and Mauritia palm swamp reduced. Between 700 and 300 cal yr BP savanna and Mauritia palm swamp increased and forest area decreased. The high amount of charred particles found in the sediments, indicate fires with a marked increase between 1400 to 1000 cal yr BP (FC site) and 700 to 300 cal yr BP (TIA site), and probably caused the retreat of forest cover during these two time intervals. The relatively lower fire activity after 300 cal yr BP until present-day favored the increase of forested area at both TIA and FC sites. The arrival of the European settler and the subsequent introduction of cattle, is suggested as the main reason for the decrease of fire in the study region. The results point the fire caused by indigenous people as the principal controlling factor for forest and savanna dynamics during the past 1550 years.\nA metre-thick ultramafic lamprophyre dyke intrudes the basement of the Tandilia belt at the Sierra Alta de Vela, Argentina. A petrological and geochemical study of this rock and associated small dykes indicates a predominantly calc-alkaline trend. Phlogopite K–Ar dating of the ultramafic lamprophyre gave a minimum age of 1928 ± 54 Ma as a late event of the Transamazonian Orogeny, which is well represented in the basement of the Tandilia belt.\nAn electron microprobe study indicates the presence of phlogopite, albite, chromite and Cr-rich phenocrysts and Cr-free microphenocrysts of diopside as primary minerals. Subsequent to deformation at the contacts with the wall rock, metasomatism generated strongly zoned amphibole (edenite, pargasite, Mg-hastingite and tremolite compositions) and andradite as well as chlorite, sericite, albite, apatite and calcite. The central zone of the lamprophyre is almost undeformed and exhibits some ocellar texture. Geochemical and isotopic signatures of the lamprophyre suggest that its magma source may have previously undergone incompatible element enrichment of the mantle source, representing the original precursor magma for the calc-alkaline dyke series of the Sierra Alta de Vela.\nA new middle Miocene vertebrate fauna from Peruvian Amazonia is described. It yields the marsupials Sipalocyon sp. (Hathliacynidae) and Marmosa (Micoureus) cf. laventica (Didelphidae), as well as an unidentified glyptodontine xenarthran and the rodents Guiomys sp. (Caviidae), “Scleromys” sp., cf. quadrangulatus-schurmanni-colombianus (Dinomyidae), an unidentified acaremyid, and cf. Microsteiromys sp. (Erethizontidae). Apatite Fission Track provides a detrital age (17.1 ± 2.4 Ma) for the locality, slightly older than its inferred biochronological age (Colloncuran-early Laventan South American Land Mammal Ages: ∼15.6–13.0 Ma). Put together, both the mammalian assemblage and lithology of the fossil-bearing level point to a mixture of tropical rainforest environment and more open habitats under a monsoonal-like tropical climate. The fully fluvial origin of the concerned sedimentary sequence suggests that the Amazonian Madre de Dios Subandean Zone was not part of the Pebas mega-wetland System by middle Miocene times. This new assemblage seems to reveal a previously undocumented “spatiotemporal transition” between the late early Miocene assemblages from high latitudes (Patagonia and Southern Chile) and the late middle Miocene faunas of low latitudes (Colombia, Perú, Venezuela, and ?Brazil).\nParticulate suspended matter concentration (SPM) were estimated over a 8 year time period (2002–2010) in the coastal waters of French Guiana from a regional algorithm applied to the MODIS monthly reflectance measurements. Comparison between SPOT images and MODIS-SPM maps revealed the strong spatio-temporal coupling between in water SPM and the dynamics of local (i.e. Kourou and Cayenne) mud banks. Highest MODIS SPM values (>13 g m−3 approximately) can be significantly associated with the subtidal part of the banks as well as to the related turbid plume. The migration of these mud banks induces strong interannual changes in SPM reaching up to 6% year−1 within increasing and decreasing patchy areas distributed alternatively along the coastline of French Guiana. Mud banks migration rates derived from MODIS SPM data reach in average about 2 km year−1 in agreement with previous studies. The MODIS time series have allowed for a detailed description of the seasonality and interannual variations in the in-water SPM loads. Seasonal changes in SPM are related to the onset of the trade wind season. Marked non-linear patterns including a sharp evolution in the SPM values around 2005 as well as additional high frequency modulations have been emphasized within the upward and downward SPM trend regions. Concurrent temporal variations in the frequency of northward swells (favoring mud banks migration and reworking) as well as interannual changes in the amount of sediment delivered by the Amazon River have been shown to play a major role in the SPM temporal patterns observed in the French Guiana coastal waters. Our results clearly demonstrate the advantage for ocean color data to describe mud banks dynamics through the assessment of in water SPM temporal variability.",

      "abstract": "Ongoing agricultural expansion in Amazonia and the surrounding areas of Brazil is expected to continue over the next several decades as global food demand increases. The transition of natural forest and savannah ecosystems to pastureland and agricultural crops is predicted to create warmer and drier atmospheric conditions than the native vegetation. Using a coupled ecosystem regional atmospheric model (EDBRAMS) we investigate the expected impacts of predicted future land use on the climate of South America. The climate response in the model simulations is generally consistent with expectations from previous global modeling simulations with drier conditions resulting from deforestation, however the changes in precipitation are relatively small (on order of a few percent). Local drying is driven primarily by decreases in evapo-transpiration associated with the loss of forest, and concomitant increases in runoff. Significant changes in convectively available potential energy (CAPE) and convective inhibition (CIN) during the transition to the wet season indicate that the decrease in surface latent heat flux is indeed leading to a drier atmosphere, however these changes occur around a mean climatological state that is already very favorable for convection, and thus lead to relatively small changes in precipitation. If, however, these land use changes were to occur under a background state of drier conditions, such as those predicted for the future global climate model experiments, this additional atmospheric drying may be sufficient to decrease precipitation more substantially.",

      "abstract": "Mountains and mountain rivers provide a multitude of invaluable goods and services to a profound portion of the planet’s population. As “water towers” of the Earth mountains are sources of the mightiest world rivers and play a pivotal role for global biodiversity, freshwater, and sediment supply. Distinct morphological, climatic, hydrological, hydrochemical, and biological features of mountainous river ecosystems, compared to lowland ones, make them particularly fragile and vulnerable to human interference. Despite a number of remote mountain areas and rivers still remaining intact from direct human pressures, the majority of mountain ecosystems, are being increasingly threatened by adverse local and global changes driven by market economy. To efficiently conserve and sustainably use mountain ecosystems and contribute to the survival of the planet, it is critical to change our standards and life attitudes by realizing and appreciating our immediate connection to the global ecosystem, change attitudes and current consumption patterns, and stimulate the ways our global society functions and interacts with the natural environment.",

This review summarizes how virus–mosquito interactions are critical for these viruses to become global pathogens at molecular, physiological, evolutionary, and epidemiological scales.

      "abstract": "Understanding food web functioning through the study of natural bio-indicators may constitute a valuable and original approach. In the context of jellyfish proliferation in many overexploited marine ecosystems studying the spatio-temporal foraging patterns of the giant “jellyvore” leatherback turtle turns out to be particularly relevant. Here we analyzed long-term tracking data to assess spatio-temporal foraging patterns in 21 leatherback turtles during their pluri-annual migration in the Northern Atlantic. Through an analytical approach based on the animal's own motion (independent of currents) and diving behavior distinct zones of high and low foraging success were identified. High foraging success occurred in a sub-equatorial zone spanning the width of the Atlantic and at high (>30°N) latitudes. Between these zones in the centre of North Atlantic gyre there was low foraging success. This “ocean desert” area was traversed at high speed by leatherbacks on their way to more productive areas at higher latitudes. Animals traveled slowly in high foraging success areas and dived shallower (17.2±8.0kmday−1 and 53.6±33.1m mean±SD respectively) than in low foraging success areas (51.0±13.1kmday−1 and 81.8±56.2m mean±SD respectively). These spatio-temporal foraging patterns seem to relatively closely match the main features of the integrated meso-zooplankton distribution in the North Atlantic. Our method of defining high foraging success areas is intuitive and relatively easy to implement but also takes into account the impact of oceanic currents on animal's behavior.",

      "abstract": "Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in the Caribbean and Pacific have gone from a place of self-sufficiency and energy independence, during pre-colonial times, to a position, in more recent times, of being (often heavily) dependent on both imported capital (loans and aid) and imported sources of energy. This paper asserts that the current dependence of Caribbean and Pacific SIDS on both development assistance from donor agencies and imported fossil fuels is not coincidental, but rather, it was due to the transition of these islands from subsistence agriculture to export-oriented economies, primarily to serve the interests of more developed metropolitan countries. These interests have included the provision of cheap raw materials and agricultural produce to imperial nations; which has meant that SIDS needed to develop export orientated economies requiring both financial capital and energy supply usually over and above that available locally. The impact of colonisation on domestic energy use and demand in SIDS is thus briefly outlined so as to make clear how these nations transitioned from self-sufficiency to dependence on foreign capital and energy. It is upon this backdrop that the current dependence of SIDS on international aid, particularly with regards to the energy sector, has been analysed, along with its influence on energy policy in SIDS. This paper suggests that while imported finance and energy have been crucial to the past development of SIDS, the extent of reliance upon external financial assistance and energy imports at present is a cause for concern not only due to long term energy security issues but also because of the climate change implications of fossil fuel use. The concern is also pressing within the context of long term debt accumulation. It is argued herein that closer attention should be paid to local capacity building, training and institutional strengthening to enable a transition to renewable energy in place of fossil fuel based power. In terms of long term resilience such capacity building could eventually include the means for the production of renewable energy technology components.",

      "abstract": "The freshwater African catfish family Amphiliidae had been reviewed based on the 73 osteological characters with Diplomystidae, † Hypsidoridae, Amblycipitidae, Sisoridae, and Bagridae as out-groups. Because the family position of Leptoglanis (Bagridae/Amphiliidae) is under debate, this genus has been taken as an out-group too. Results of the study indicate that: 1) the Amphiliidae is not a monophyletic group and must now be restricted to the genera Amphilius and Paramphilius; the two subfamilies Amphiliinae and Doumeinae are separated by the sisorids Euchiloglanis (with most of the glyptosternid fishes) and Glyptothorax (with most of the non-glyptosternid fishes); 2) no synapomorphies were found for the subfamily Amphiliinae. 3) The five genera of subfamily Doumeinae constitute a monophyletic group, Andersonia being the sister-group of the four other genera; subfamily Doumeinae + Leptoglanis form the family Doumeidae. The glyptosternids no longer belong to the Sisoridae (family restricted to the non-glyptosternids) and represent the new family Glyptosternidae.\nRésumé\nLa famille des Amphiliidae, poissons-chats d'eau douce d'Afrique, a été revue sur la base de 73 caractères ostéologiques avec comme out-groups les Diplomystidae, les † Hypsidoridae, les Amblycipitidae, les Sisoridae et les Bagridae.

      "abstract": "Renewable energy is fundamental for sustainable development challenges and social sciences advances. The development agenda prescribes to pursue renewable energy policies as a pillar of energy security and sustainable development in both developed and developing countries. A major policy implication for renewable energy derives from entrepreneurship boosting, targeting women, rural, youth, and vulnerable categories, where microfinance and resilience policies have found a wide consensus. The present work exploits a statistical approach to measure energy policy effectiveness, making use of the brand-new IBRD-World Bank release SDG7 Tracking: The Energy Progress Report. A composite indicator of renewable energy policy is built, exploring different perspectives. The determinants of energy policy effectiveness are analyzed. A statistical comparison of the different results is relevant to ensure robustness implications. We discover that countries endowed with natural resources, such as Brazil, perform better in renewable energy consumption. We confirm that green countries, e.g. the Nordic region, maintain a high renewable energy consumption attitude. We also validate that oil exporters – and notably most of the Arab countries –, are usually less prone to use renewable energy. These implications are foremost for the vulnerable empowerment and societal challenges required to foster the energy transition.",

      "abstract": "This paper introduces several notions and a collection of manuscripts compiled for a special section of The Extractive Industries and Society on the temporal and spatial trajectories of mining territories. These papers were developed from presentations delivered at two international conferences held in 2018: the TRAMIN (“Socio-environmental Trajectories of Mining Territories”) conference and the Social Geology session at the RFG (“Resources for Future Generations”) conference, that took place respectively in Chambéry (France) and Vancouver (Canada). The introduction paper situates these pieces in the wider literature, exploring the connections between mineral resources and the development of societies that exploit, transform and sell them. It also argues that using a polyphonic notion such as “trajectories” allows for the adoption of an interdisciplinary approach leading to key insights on sustainability for mining territories.",

Parsimony analysis of endemicity, UPGMA clustering and NMDS ordination were computed with data of 18 localities and 245 species, all indicating that the northern Atlantic Forest is more related to the Amazon than to its southern portion. Also the results agree with the hypothesis that the Brejos Nordestinos is a distinct biota from both the Amazon and Atlantic Forest. Annual temperature and rainfall are strongly related with the resulting NDMS site scores. A distance similarity decay of similarity analysis suggests a moderate to low, but statistically significant, influence of the geographic distance on assemblages' composition. The limited distribution of many poroid fungal taxa also emphasizes the fragility of these organisms to habitat loss.",

      "abstract": "Mangroves of New Caledonia act as a buffer between a lagoon of more than 20,000km2 and the Island, which suffers intense processes of erosion resulting from urbanization and natural resources exploitation. This preliminary study aims at determining how heavy metals are distributed in mangrove sediments and pore-waters in relationship with their organic content. To reach our goal, a series of 50-cm deep cores were collected in the mangrove of Conception Bay. The various coring sites are representative of live forests (Avicennia marina, Rhizophora stylosa), dead forest, and intertidal unvegetated area. The ranges of concentrations in sediments were the following (μmolg−1): Cu (0.08 to 0.51), Co (0.01 to 0.38), Ni (0.03 to 3.55), Cr (0.36 to 3.11), Zn (0.68 to 2.36), Mn (1.13 to 5.0) and Fe (22.64 to 721.69). Heavy metals distribution within sediments and pore-water appear to result from diagenetic processes linked to OM decomposition. Beneath the dead Avicennia forest and in the unvegetated sediments, the higher the organic content, the higher the metal concentration in the solid phase. Beneath living mangrove stands, despite a higher organic content, as well as higher sulphur content, heavy metals concentrations were not higher than those measured in the other sampling sites. Beneath these forests, redox conditions were mainly controlled by the length of waterlogging and the activity of root system. We suggest that, because of the specificity of the Avicennia root system and its position in the intertidal zone, heavy metals are more bioavailable and potentially more mobile than beneath Rhizophora stand.",

      "abstract": "Because many environmental threats span national boundaries, transboundary networks have emerged as a form of multi-stakeholder platform to support environmental governance (EG). There are transboundary networks in various ecologically important regions of the world such as the Amazon. However, there remains a need for systematic analyses to adequately evaluate the contributions of transboundary networks to EG. This paper takes up the case of the “MAP Initiative”, a transboundary network in the tri-national frontier of the southwestern Amazon that sought to support EG. We examine three key questions: 1) how do transboundary networks motivate participants to engage in collaboration across boundaries for EG, 2) how do transboundary networks evolve structurally as well as strategically to increase their impact on EG, and 3) can transboundary networks generate outcomes beyond information sharing for EG? The analysis draws on historical documents, participant observation, and key informant interviews about the MAP Initiative. The findings confirm that transboundary networks motivate cross-border exchanges in multiple ways, they evolve structurally in multiple ways that increase their capacity, and that evolution supports multiple forms of activities and outcomes that support EG. We conclude with a discussion of the contributions and challenges of transboundary networks regarding EG.",

      "abstract": "Mangrove forests can fix and store high quantities of carbon both in their soil and in their biomass, the latter peaking in the equatorial regions and decreasing with latitude. In Vietnam, more than 80% of the mangroves develop either in the Mekong Delta or in the Can Gio Estuary, which are characterized by tropical monsoon climates. Most of these mangroves were planted and are dominated by Rhizophora apiculata Blume. The main objectives of this study were to determine forest structure, above-ground biomass and carbon conversion factors for each tree component in order to obtain allometric equations and to derive carbon stocks for managed Rhizophora stands of different ages developing within this context. Thirty-six trees, having a diameter at breast height (DBH) ranging from 7.0 to 36.2 cm, from a planted mangrove forest were harvested in Ca Mau (Mekong Delta) to determine allometric equations. In addition, thirteen plots were established in both Ca Mau and Can Gio mangrove forests, to determine above-ground carbon densities. We proposed the following specific allometric equation to estimate total above-ground biomass (kg) for managed R. apiculata mangrove stands in Southern Vietnam: WTotal = 0.38363 * DBH2.2348 (R2 = 0.976, SE = 1.17, F = 1401, P < 0.001). The total above-ground biomass ranged from 135.4 to 523.6 Mg ha−1 depending on forest age and tree density. Consequently, and taking into account a carbon conversion factor of 44.09%, carbon stocks in the above-ground biomass of R. apiculata mangrove forests in Southern Vietnam ranged from 59.7 to 230.9 Mg C ha−1. The mean carbon partitioning in the tree biomass was: 77.11% for trunks, 11.87% for branches, 8.66% for prop roots, and 2.36% for leaves. However, this distribution, as well as annual height increments and biomass increase rates, also varied with forest age and tree densities. We suggested that tree density reduction through thinning activities allowed easier tree development, resulting in an increased biomass with enhanced allocation to branches and above-ground prop roots for the stability of the trees. Using the specific allometric equation and specific carbon conversion factor reduced the uncertainty in the estimation of above-ground biomass and carbon stocks.",

      "abstract": "Acid soil savannas of tropical America are a vast resource to expand agricultural production, alleviate the pressure on tropical rainforest and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. During the past three decades there have been major changes in land use in the Cerrados of Brazil and to a lesser extent in the Llanos of Colombia. Monocropping and improved pasture grasses were adopted widely to boost crop and animal production. Various types of integrated crop-livestock systems and no-till cropping systems were introduced to not only recuperate degraded pastures but also to sustain crop and livestock productivity. Several studies showed that well-managed pastures based on deep rooted tropical forage grass and legume species could accumulate significant amounts of soil organic carbon (SOC) in deeper soil layers. Among the number of factors that influence SOC accumulation, deep rooting ability of grasses and high root turnover seem to play a major role in accumulation of SOC in deeper soil layers in the form of particulate organic carbon (POC) and mineral associated organic carbon (MAOC). This review provides insights toward some key approaches and management options to increase both POC and MAOC accumulation and particularly MAOC accumulation in deeper soil layers in crop-livestock systems. There are some important gaps in our knowledge, particularly regarding the influence of length of pasture phase on MAOC accumulation in deeper soil layers from crop-livestock systems. Finally, we highlight the importance of land use policies and suggest some future research priorities for consideration to increase benefits from the use of integrated crop-livestock systems in acid soil savannas.",

      "abstract": "Ecosystem service (ES) assessments have flourished globally in recent years and are now frequently used by policymakers and environmental managers. However, data scarce regions continue to be less well studied, limiting the comprehensiveness of the approach and its potential benefits. Here we aim to assess multiple ES and their spatial relationships in a region with high tropical forest cover, the state of Amapá, in the Brazilian Amazon. We develop a simple method to measure nine ES, identify spatial associations between them, and explore the impact of land use change on the capacity of forests to provide those services. The ES analysed include biodiversity, regional climate regulation, indigenous heritage, agricultural production, and NTFP extraction. Both negative (n = 20) and positive (n = 12) spatial associations are found, with agricultural land and forests having the highest total ES provision. We also show that this varies nonlinearly with distance to forest edges. In the face of currently unavoidable data scarcities in high biodiversity tropical areas, we show that this approach can provide useful evidence for land use management decisions.",

The goal of this study was to model the potential distribution of A. grandis and discuss the aspect of its ecological niche. The species distribution model was built using the Maximum Entropy method - Maxent, which showed an extensive environmental suitability area in all continents of tropical and subtropical climates. The main prediction variables for the A. grandis establishment were average annual temperature and rainfall. Thus, worldwide locations sustaining similar conditions may be invaded by the fly, including areas where the pest is considered a quarantine pest such as, for instance, the south of the United States.",

      "abstract": "Tropical forests are acknowledged to be the largest global source of isoprene (C5H8) and monoterpenes (C10H16) emissions, with current synthesis studies suggesting few tropical species emit isoprenoids (20–38%) and do so with highly variable emission capacities, including within the same genera. This apparent lack of a clear phylogenetic thread has created difficulties both in linking isoprenoid function with evolution and for the development of accurate biosphere-atmosphere models. Here, we present a systematic emission study of “hyperdominant” tree species in the Amazon Basin. Across 162 individuals, distributed among 25 botanical families and 113 species, isoprenoid emissions were widespread among both early and late successional species (isoprene: 61.9% of the species; monoterpenes: 15.0%; both isoprene and monoterpenes: 9.7%). The hyperdominant species (69) across the top five most abundant genera, which make up about 50% of all individuals in the Basin, had a similar abundance of isoprenoid emitters (isoprene: 63.8%; monoterpenes: 17.4%; both 11.6%). Among the abundant genera, only Pouteria had a low frequency of isoprene emitting species (15.8% of 19 species). In contrast, Protium, Licania, Inga, and Eschweilera were rich in isoprene emitting species (83.3% of 12 species, 61.1% of 18 species, 100% of 8 species, and 100% of 12 species, respectively). Light response curves of individuals in each of the five genera showed light-dependent, photosynthesis-linked emission rates of isoprene and monoterpenes. Importantly, in every genus, we observed species with light-dependent isoprene emissions together with monoterpenes including β-ocimene. These observations support the emerging view of the evolution of isoprene synthases from β-ocimene synthases. Our results have important implications for understanding isoprenoid function-evolution relationships and the development of more accurate Earth System Models.",

      "abstract": "Avoiding whinges from various and potentially conflicting stakeholders is a major challenge for sustainable development and for the identification of sustainability scenarios or policies for biodiversity and ecosystem services. It turns out that independently complying with whinge thresholds and constraints of these stakeholders is not sufficient because dynamic ecological-economic interactions and uncertainties occur. Thus more demanding no whinge standards are needed. In this paper, we first argue that these new boundaries can be endogenously exhibited with the mathematical concepts of viability kernel and viable controls. Second, it is shown how these no whinge kernels have components, such as harvesting of resources, that should remain within safe corridor while some other components, in particular biodiversity, have only lower conservation limits. Thus, using radar charts, we show how this no whinge kernels can take the shape of a tree that we name viability tree. These trees of viability capture the idea that the unbounded renewal potential of biodiversity combined with a bounded use of the different ecosystem services are crucial ingredients for the sustainability of socio-ecosystems and the design of no whinge policies reconciling the different stakeholders involved.",

      "abstract": "In view of the scenario of global warming, understanding how individuals disperse and populations fluctuate in response to climatic extremes is becoming increasingly important. Thereby, we used a capture-mark-recapture approach on Columbina minuta and Columbina picui in two Caatinga physiognomies (shrubby-woodland and savanna) during and following a prolonged drought in northeastern Brazil. We evaluated three hypotheses: density is higher in the savanna, doves are more abundant during the rainy season, and doves are able to undertake regional movements in response to drought. We used Huggins closed population models to estimate detection rates and population size. The results revealed low capture and recapture rates, greater abundance in the savanna, a higher density of C. minuta in both study areas, and a higher density of both species in the rainy season. We also observed that the prolonged drought has negatively impacted on doves density. The recovery of banded individuals at other sites indicates that nomadism may be the principal strategy adopted by doves to endure periods of drought. Our findings show that conservation units in the Caatinga are important to conservation of granivorous birds and contribute to understanding the birds' strategies to face seasonality and severely dry periods in semiarid areas.",

      "abstract": "This article explores the impact of electricity production broken down by energy source (fossils and renewables) on carbon dioxide emissions in South America over the 1980–2010 period. The contribution of the manuscript is in the analysis of the relationships between carbon dioxide emissions, the energy mix in electricity generation and its implications for economic growth in a region still insufficiently studied. Using ARDL approach, the empirical findings provide evidence of the cross-sectional dependence in the data and existence of cointegration. The pollution has a relationship with economic growth, and the fossil electricity in short-run. The estimations strongly reveal that renewable energy has a negative effect on CO2 emissions in long run. Also, in the long-run, fossil electricity has shown results become statistically insignificant. However, the adjustment mechanism corrected the model by around 27% in the following period. In this way, the electricity production at aggregate level is used a factor environmental pressure and as an indicator of economic activity in South America countries, where the renewable energy with an increasing long-run effect, remains an efficient substitute for the fossil-electricity. Thus, we recommend to the countries of South America that they maintain the long-term efforts to produce electricity from renewable sources.",

      "abstract": "Deforestation is considered the main human-induced and short-term threat to the persistence of forest species in the Amazon. Long-lasting and high-intensity deforestation, low coverage of protected areas, and high level of species endemism make the Belém Endemism Area (BEA) particularly more vulnerable than the rest of the Amazon area. However, this occurrence remains strongly neglected in global and regional conservation analyses. In this study, we used species distribution modeling and remote sensing data to map the richness pattern of endangered birds from the Amazon and assessed the species' conservation status based on landscape patterns of forest remnants. Our results revealed that the BEA's imperiled avifauna presents the most significant state of vulnerability to extinction compared with other areas of endemism in the Amazon. Almost 80 % of the total area of the BEA presents a strong anthropization of natural ecosystems. Of the 20 % of the area with high conservation value remnants, only 25 % is within protected areas, whereas the other 75 % is under private property domains. Moreover, forest remnants on private properties have a higher biodiversity conservation value as they are home to more threatened bird species than remnants within protected areas. Therefore, we argue that effective implementation of conservation of threatened bird species in the BEA depends directly on the maintenance of forest remnants on private properties from practical conservation actions.",

      "abstract": "The Pleistocene Coropina Formation largely constitutes the Old Coastal Plain of Suriname. It is exposed fully only in open-pit bauxite mines in the central coastal plain as part of the unconsolidated overburden of Paleocene–Eocene bauxites. This study deals with the stratigraphy, sedimentology and chronology of this formation, and is based on a study in the recently closed Lelydorp-III bauxite mine operated by N.V. BHP Billiton Maatschappij Suriname. The Coropina Formation consists of the Para and Lelydorp Members. We present a detailed lithological subdivision of these members. In the Para Member, four units are discerned which are grouped in two transgressive cycles, both ranging upward from terrestrial towards chenier and coastal mudflat deposits reflecting glacio-eustatic sea-level changes. The sandy sediments represent fluviatile and beach-bar (chenier) deposits, and were supplied by rivers from the Precambrian basement and to a lesser extent by westward longshore coastal drift. Clays, largely derived from the Amazon River and transported alongshore over the shelf, were deposited in extensive coastal mudflats. The Lelydorp Member, also comprising four units, represents a depositional system that is closely comparable to the recent Suriname coastal setting, i.e., a lateral and vertical alternation of mudflat and chenier deposits formed over a period characterised by more or less constant sea level. Palaeomagnetic data indicate a dominantly reversed magnetic polarity in the Para Member, whereas the Lelydorp Member shows a normal magnetic polarity with a minor reversed polarity overprint. The reversed polarities of the Para Member exclude a Brunhes Chron (0.78–0.0 Ma) age, and thus assign it to the Matuyama Chron (2.58–0.78 Ma). This implies that the Coropina Formation is much older than hitherto assumed, and that one or more (long-term) hiatuses are not recognizable in the lithological succession.",

      "abstract": "New research presented in this special issue of Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution on the “Phylogeny and Biogeography of Neotropical Primates” greatly improves our understanding of the evolutionary history of the New World monkeys and provides insights into the multiple platyrrhine radiations, diversifications, extinctions, and recolonizations that have taken place over time and over space in the Neotropics. Here, we synthesize genetic and biogeographic research from the past several years to construct an overarching hypothesis for platyrrhine evolution. We also highlight continuing controversies in Neotropical primate biogeography, such as whether the location of origin of platyrrhines was Africa or Asia; whether Patagonian fossil primates are stem or crown platyrrhines; and whether cis- and trans-Andean Neotropical primates were subject to vicariance through Andes mountain building, or instead diversified through isolation in mountain valleys after skirting around the Andes on the northwestern coast of South America. We also consider the role of the Amazon River and its major tributaries in shaping platyrrhine biodiversity, and how and when primates from the Amazon reached the Atlantic Forest. A key focus is on primate colonizations and extirpations in Central America, the Andes, and the seasonally dry tropical forests and savannas (such as the Llanos, Caatinga, and Cerrado habitats), all ecosystems that have been understudied up until now for primates. We suggest that most primates currently inhabiting drier open habitats are relatively recent arrivals, having expanded from rainforest habitats in the Pleistocene. We point to the Pitheciidae as the taxonomic group most in need of further phylogenetic and biogeographic research. Additionally, genomic studies on the Platyrrhini are deeply needed and are expected to bring new surprises and insights to the field of Neotropical primate biogeography.",

      "abstract": "The threat of man-induced global change on the nations of the wider Caribbean region varies from place to place because of differences in exposure to storms, differences in local tectonics and subsidence, and variations in land-use practices. Because of the large number of nations involved, many having only subsistence budgets, and the cost of deriving independently a comprehensive response to global change, the similarities and differences between national settings must be identified soon. These comparisons will form the basis for local response strategies; the common elements between nations provide a basis for responses similar to those other nations, whereas the differences mandate local adaptation. That the Caribbean will be impacted by climate change is certain: its environment, land uses, and economies are dictated in large part by this marine influence. Accompanying global change will be changes in sea level, differences in storm climate, and altered precipitation patterns; science cannot define today what form these changes will take. Because global change is inevitable—although its magnitude, timing, and geographic distribution are unknown—the wider Caribbean should begin the appropriate research and planning studies to set forth a response to global change, for implementation when scientific evidence for global change is more quantitative.",

      "abstract": "Mangrove-mud coasts across the world erode because of uninformed management, conversion of mangrove forests into aquaculture ponds, development of infrastructure and urbanization, and/or extraction of groundwater inducing land subsidence. The accompanied loss of ecosystem values, amongst which safety against flooding, has far reaching consequences for coastal communities, exacerbated by sea-level rise. To halt erosion various nature-based solutions have been implemented as an alternative to hard infrastructure sea defenses, including mangrove planting and erection of low-tech structures such as bamboo fences, permeable brushwood dams, etc. These structures have been designed on the basis of best-engineering practice, lacking sufficient scientific background. This paper investigates the use and success of permeable dams over a period of about 15 years, describing their application in Guyana, Indonesia, Suriname, Thailand and Vietnam, summarizing the lessons-learned, and analyzing their functioning in relation to the physical-biological coastal system. Also an overview of relevant costs is given. The basic philosophy behind the construction of permeable dams is the rehabilitation of mangrove habitat through re-establishment of the (fine) sediment dynamics – we refer to Building with Nature as the overarching principle of this approach. Our main conclusions are that a successful functioning of permeable dams requires (1) a thorough understanding of the physical-biological system and analysis of the relevant processes, (2) patience and persistence, including maintenance, as the natural time scales to rehabilitate mangrove green belts take years to decades, and (3) intensive stakeholder involvement. We give a list of conditions under which permeable dams may be successful, but in qualitative terms, as local site conditions largely govern their success or failure.",

      "abstract": "Because many biological processes related to the dynamics of infectious diseases are caused by complex interactions between the environment, the host(s) and the agent(s), the necessity to address the methodological implications of this inherent complexity has recently emerged in epidemiology. Most epidemiologists now acknowledge that most human infectious diseases are likely to have complex dynamics. However, this knowledge still percolates with difficulty in their statistical “modus operandi”. Indeed, for the study of complex systems, the traditional first-line statistical toolbox of epidemiologists (mainly built around the Generalized Linear Model family), despite its undeniable practicality and robustness, has structural limitations deprecating its usefulness. Three major sources of complexity neglected or not taken into account by this first-line statistical toolbox and having deep statistical implications are the multi-level organization of data, the non-linear relationships between variables and the complex interactions between variables. Three promising candidates to incorporate along with traditional tools for a new first-line statistical toolbox more suitable to apprehend these sources of complexity are the generalized linear mixed models, the generalized additive models, and the structural equation models. The aforementioned methodologies have the advantage to be generalizations of GLM models and are relatively easy to implement. Their assimilation and implementation would thus be greatly facilitated for epidemiologists. More globally, this text underlines that an improved use of other methods as such described here compared to traditional ones has to be performed to better understand the complexity challenging epidemiologists every day. This is particularly true in the field of infectious diseases for which major public health challenges will have to be addressed in the coming decades.",

For sea turtles (a species displaying temperature sex determination) nesting throughout the tropics and subtropics, rainfall has previously been shown to influence the development environment of clutches; in its extreme resulting in high levels of egg or hatchling mortality. Yet when compared to other abiotic variables affecting clutch success, rainfall has received relatively little attention. We therefore examined how fluctuations in local rainfall at a tropical nesting site for leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) affected the nest environment. Temperature data loggers placed within clutches (n=8) revealed that protracted rainfall had a marked cooling effect on nests, so that seasonally improbable male-producing temperatures (<29.75 °C) were produced. We use these data to explore how rainfall may ultimately influence the sex ratios of sea turtle hatchlings both within and between nesting seasons, and discuss the importance of robust estimates of rainfall for future demographic models.",

      "abstract": "The need to reconcile food production, ecosystem services and biodiversity conservation has spurred the search for more sustainable ways of farming. Archaeology offers examples of prehistoric pathways to agricultural intensification that could be rich sources of inspiration for applying ecological engineering in agriculture today. We examine one set of techniques, pre-Columbian raised-field agriculture in wetlands of Mesoamerica and South America. We point to gaps in knowledge at three levels. First, raised-field agriculture was conducted in a wide range of soils and climates. How different systems functioned was likely to have been correspondingly diverse, but this variation is under-appreciated. At the scale of single farms, nutrient dynamics in raised-field systems likely included complexities quite unusual in ‘modern’ agriculture, owing to the mixture of aerobic and waterlogged compartments, but data are scarce. Second, at the landscape level there is disagreement about whether fallow periods were necessary, and their eventual roles are poorly understood. Current evidence suggests that self-organizing processes in fallows may have increased the sustainability of some raised-field farming systems in unusual ways. Third, the labor-intensive nature of raised-field farming is held to limit its pertinence to today's global problems, but its real labor costs are unknown. Furthermore, achieving sustainable intensive agriculture will require compensating farmers for ecosystem services they provide. Under a socioeconomic regime that does this, raised-field agriculture could have considerable practical application.",

      "abstract": "The skillful prediction of soil moisture can provide much help for many practical applications including ecosystem management and precision agriculture. It presents great challenges because the future variation of soil moisture has much uncertainty. Therefore, a novel encoder-decoder deep learning model with residual learning based on Long Short-Term Memory (EDT-LSTM) is developed in this study as an alternative data-intelligence tool. This model includes two layers: the encoder-decoder LSTM layer and LSTM with a fully connected layer, which is used to enhance the prediction ability by considering the intermediate time-series data between the input time step and the predictive time step. We tested EDT-LSTM for soil moisture prediction at the lead time of 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 days by using data from FLUXNET sites. The result shows that the improvements brought by EDT-LSTM were about 7.95% (1 day), 10.10% (3 days), 12.68% (5 days), 15.49% (7 days) and 19.71% (10 days) in average according to the R2 taking LSTM as the baseline. Furthermore, the predictability of soil moisture over various conditions (i.e., different hyper-parameters in EDT-LSTM, different predictive models, different climate regions and different sites) has been widely discussed for the understanding of models’ behavior in this paper. The proposed EDT-LSTM offered a new tool to predict soil moisture better. The code of EDT-LSTM is publicly available at https://github.com/ljz1228/CLM-LSTM-soil-moisture-prediction.",

      "abstract": "Logging is a pervasive disturbance, which often causes extensive destruction of forest community structure and severely impacts biodiversity in tropical regions. Previous work on the effects of anthropogenic activities on biodiversity have concentrated on taxonomic diversity. However, the effects of disturbances such as logging on the functional composition of communities (and thereby, ecosystem function) are poorly understood. Here, we examined variation in the functional traits and assembly processes of tropical montane rain forest communities along a gradient of logging intensity (clear-cut, selective logging, and old-growth) at three spatial scales (100 m2, 400 m2, and 2500 m2) in China. We measured six functional traits of species, including specific leaf area (SLA), leaf dry matter content (LDMC), leaf chlorophyll (LChl), leaf nitrogen content (LNC), leaf phosphorus content (LPC), and wood density (WD) in each forest plot. Functional composition changed along the disturbance gradient from logged to old-growth forests. Species with resource-acquisitive strategies (high SLA, LNC, and LPC) dominated the clear-cut forest. In contrast, species with resource-conservative strategies (high LDMC, LChl, and WD) dominated the old-growth forest, while species in the selectively-logged forest showed intermediate values. Across forests with different logging intensities, environmental filtering appeared to be the key process governing community assembly. Spatial scale had a significant effect on functional diversity and community assemblage but did not affect functional traits at the community level. At larger spatial scales, the functional richness and functional dispersion of the three forest types all increased and different community assembly processes were more obvious. Logged forests still need more time to recover levels of functional diversity observed in old-growth forest. Selective logging maintained more functional diversity than clear-cutting in these tropical montane rain forests.",

      "abstract": "Natural ecosystem change over time is an often unconsidered issue for PES and REDD+ schemes, and a lack of consideration of thermodynamic limitations has led to misconceptions and oversimplifications regarding ecosystem services, especially for tropical mangrove forests. Mangroves are non-linear, non-equilibrium systems uniquely adapted to a highly dynamic boundary where shorelines are continually evolving and sea-level ever changing, and rarely conform to classical concepts of forest development and succession. Not all mangroves accumulate carbon and rates of forest floor accretion are directly linked to the frequency of tidal inundation. Carbon payments in either a PES or REDD+ scheme are dependent on the rate of carbon sequestration, not the size of C stocks, so site selection must be ordinarily confined to the sea edge. Gas emissions and net ecosystem production (NEP) are linked to forest age, particularly for monospecific plantations. Planting of mixed-species forests is recommended to maximize biodiversity, food web connectivity and NEP. Old-growth forests are the prime ecosystems for carbon sequestration, and policy must give priority to schemes to maintain their existence. Large uncertainties exist in carbon sequestration potential of mangroves, and such limitations must be factored into the design, timeframe and execution of PES and REDD+ schemes.",

      "abstract": "Because survey-based species lists for fine-scale areas are generally lacking, ecologists have been using species lists derived from modeled range maps in macroecological studies. Here I evaluate whether it is appropriate to use species lists derived from modeled range maps in macroecological studies. I compared species lists derived from about 90,000 range maps in the Botanical Information and Ecology Network (BIEN) for over 180 geographic regions (12 broad regions covering the whole of the New World; 172 smaller regions, i.e. Taxonomic Databases Working Group units) with those representing complete or nearly complete species lists obtained from the literature for the regions. I determined the completeness of native species composition and proportion of false presences and exotic (non-native) species in species lists derived from range maps in BIEN. I determined whether errors in species lists derived from modeled range maps affect macroecological inferences by comparing the relationships of α- and β-diversity with geographic and climatic variables between different datasets (i.e. species lists derived from range maps versus complete or nearly complete species lists derived from the literature). The completeness for native species lists derived from range maps was 60–74%, depending on spatial scale. On average, 65% of the species in a species list derived from BIEN for a geographic area are false presences or non-native species to the area. The relationships of α- and β-diversity derived from the BIEN dataset with geographic and climatic variables differ significantly from those derived from complete species lists. This study shows that the results of a macroecological study based on species lists derived from modeled range maps may be substantially incorrect due to high percentages of missing native species, and high numbers of non-native species and false presences. Thus, it may not be appropriate to use species lists derived from modeled range maps in the macroecological studies that require complete or nearly complete species lists.",

      "abstract": "In 2006, the Brazilian Forest Service (SFB) started an ambitious program to establish forest concessions so as to provide a legal framework for long-term sustainable timber production in Amazonian forests. Forest concessions in the Brazilian Amazon currently cover only 1.6 million ha (Mha) but we estimate the area of all potential concessions as 35 Mha. This paper assessed the conditions under which the present and potential concession system can ensure an annual production of 11 Mm3. yr−1 to meet the estimated present timber demand. For this we used the volume dynamics with differential equations model (VDDE) calibrated for the Amazon Basin with a Bayesian framework with data from 3500 ha of forest plots monitored for as long as 30 years after selective logging. Predictions of commercial volume recovery rates vary with location. We tested 27 different scenarios by using combinations of initial proportion of commercial volume, logging intensity and cutting cycle length. These scenarios were then applied to the current area of concessions and to the area of all potential concessions (35 Mha). Under current logging regulations and the current concession area (mean logging intensity of 15–20 m3.ha−1, a harvest cycle of 35 years and an initial commercial timber volume proportion of 20%), timber production can be maintained only for a single cutting cycle (35 years). Only the scenario with a logging intensity of 10 m3ha−1 every 60 years with a 90% initial proportion of commercial timber species can be considered as sustainable. Under this scenario, the maximum annual production with the present concession areas is 159,000 m3 (157–159), or less than 2% of the present annual production of 11 Mm3. When considering all potential concession areas (35 Mha), under current rules, the total annual production is 10 Mm3yr−1 (2–17 Mm3yr−1, 95% credibility interval) but is not maintained after the first logging cycle. Under the most sustainable scenario (see above) and a concession area of 35 Mha, the long-term sustainable annual production of timber reaches only 3.4 Mm3yr−1. Based on these results we argue that the concession system will not be able to supply the timber demand without substantial reforms in natural forest management practices and in the wood industry sector. We argue that alternative sources of timber, including plantations linked with forest restoration initiatives, must be promoted.",

      "abstract": "South America possesses distinctive and diverse river basins that are integral to the continent's natural, cultural, and socioeconomic identities. The geomorphologic and hydrological features of South American river systems are linked to the continent's unique tectonic and geographic settings. High rainfall rates across large interior basins make the Amazon, Orinoco, and Paraná Rivers three of the six highest discharge rivers in the world. Relatively small coastal rivers drain the Guyanas, much of the Atlantic Coast of Brazil, and the entire Pacific margin of the Andes. To the extreme south of the continent, temperate rivers drain the Argentine pampas and Patagonia Steppe. The diverse geographic and climatic settings of South American River Basins produce correspondingly diverse assemblages of riverine habitats and species. Rivers are integral to the welfare and development potential of South America's population, providing services ranging from water supply to important inland fisheries and hydroelectricity. Human pressures on the continent's river systems have lead to widespread contamination, disruption of natural flow regimes, land-cover conversion, and overexploitation of riverine resources. Improved river resource management and sustainable development are inextricably linked in South America.",

      "abstract": "The accurate and consistent identification of fossil pollen is essential to allow robust inferences to be drawn with regard to past vegetation and climate change. Identifications are best achieved through the direct inspection of reference material. Most substantial reference collections are located at research institutions in Europe or North America, which restricts access for researchers trying to advance palynology in less developed countries. Due to the development of digital imaging and fast internet access it is now possible to produce high quality images from pollen and spore reference collections and make them globally available. In this pollen and spore atlas we contribute to this growing body of work by presenting images of 240 pollen types (in 202 genera and ∼79 families) and 30 spore types (in 25 genera and ∼17 families) from a wide range of different vegetation types originating from the Kilimanjaro area and tropical East Africa. We provide an overview on the range of pollen and spore types commonly found in Last Glacial and Holocene sedimentary archives in studies from the Kilimanjaro area and tropical East Africa. Besides a pollen key, detailed information is given on pollination, habitus and habitat which all support the interpretation and environmental reconstructions from pollen records. The atlas will serve as useful guide for palynological investigations, aiming at detailed and comprehensive reconstruction of past vegetation, environmental and climate change in tropical East Africa.",

      "abstract": "Forests worldwide are threatened by various environmental and anthropogenic hazards, especially tropical forests. Knowledge on the impacts of these hazards on forest structure and dynamics has been compiled in empirical studies. However, the results of these studies are often not sufficient for long-term projections and extrapolations to large spatial scales especially for unprecedented environmental conditions, which require both the identification and understanding of key underlying processes. Forest models bridge this gap by incorporating multiple ecological processes in a dynamic framework (i.e. including a realistic model structure) and addressing the complexity of forest ecosystems. Here, we describe the evolution of the individual-based and process-based forest gap model FORMIND and its application to tropical forests. At its core, the model includes physiological processes on tree level (photosynthesis, respiration, tree growth, mortality, regeneration, competition). During the past two decades, FORMIND has been used to address various scientific questions arising from different forest types by continuously extending the model structure. The model applications thus provided understanding in three main aspects: (1) the grouping of single tree species into plant functional types is a successful approach to reduce complexity in vegetation models, (2) structural realism was necessary to analyze impacts of natural and anthropogenic disturbances such as logging, fragmentation, or drought, and (3) complex ecological processes such as carbon fluxes in tropical forests – starting from the individual tree level up to the entire forest ecosystem – can be explored as a function of forest structure, species composition and disturbance regime. Overall, this review shows how the evolution of long-term modelling projects not only provides scientific understanding of forest ecosystems, but also provides benefits for ecological theory and empirical study design.",

      "abstract": "Riverine forests in the Brazilian Amazon provide a series of ecosystem services and harbor one of the world's most diverse floras, but the main drivers of variation in small spatial scales in such tropical forests are not well understood. Our aim was to evaluate tree community structure and diversity patterns in the Teles Pires River to identify the main drivers of small-scale variations in the area. We sampled 4,180 individuals from 49 botanical families, 164 genera and 347 species by using six transects of five pairs of 50 m x 40 m permanent plots totalizing 60 permanent plots in a 12-hectare area. We utilized generalized linear mixed models to assess whether the effects of the environmental variables in the vegetation structural parameters. Altitude and groundwater depth were the main drivers influencing species diversity patterns. The trees had similar total biomass in areas within the same distance from the river margins. There was a lower species richness and tree density closer to the river margins. Otherwise, we found larger trees (higher individual biomass) closer to the river margins when compared to areas distant from the margins. Our results indicate a high species turnover from the river margins to the forest interior, which highlights the importance of assessing local effects on biological communities in tropical forests, especially in the Brazilian Amazon where several high-impact dams are planned.",

      "abstract": "Over-exploited fresh water resources, fossil-fuel depletion and climate change all highlight need for desalination powered by renewable energy. This study briefly reviews literature on solar desalination technologies and examines economic and environmental feasibility. The maturest technology appears to be reverse osmosis driven by photovoltaics. Many studies refer to apparent spatial coincidences of water scarcity, solar energy abundance and saline water availability, but none examine the phenomenon objectively from a global perspective. This study proposes a method for correlating international data on water scarcity and stress, saline water resources, and insolation levels, to calculate rank scores (0 ≤ R ≤ 1) which identify where solar desalination is most applicable. Low scores (R < 0.125) occur in landlocked nations with limited saline groundwater resources (Nepal, Bolivia, South Sudan) and near polar regions where fresh water is abundant and solar insolation levels are low (Canada, Russia and Scandinavia). High scores (R > 0.422) occur in 30 nations, including Middle Eastern and North African countries where fossil fuelled desalination is commonplace, and solar desalination has obvious applicability. The analysis identifies 28 further countries (including parts of USA, China, India, Indonesia, Australia, and countries throughout Africa, Asia, South America and Europe) where 0.273 < R < 0.422 scores indicate that other, less obvious, solar desalination opportunities exist.",

      "abstract": "Peat is an accumulation of partially decayed vegetation. It is used mainly for two different purposes—horticulture and energy. Large areas of peatlands have been degraded in many countries around the world, but it is estimated that about 80% of the world's peatlands are still in their natural state. A real threat to the use of peat in the energy sector is constituted by carbon trading. Strong objections have been voiced to the industrial utilization of peatlands and many campaigns were organized in the 1990s to stop peat harvesting. If national solutions, such as taxation, are not used to balance the situation, calculated emissions from peat combustion based on the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) system are likely to lead to a very high cost of power and heat production from peat. Depending on the price of CO2 emissions in the carbon trade, it is estimated that the use of peat as fuel might, in the worst case, fall to one-third of the present level.",

      "abstract": "Safeguarding food security is one of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. When food production reaches its technological peak, a shortage of arable land will be the key factor that limits food production. Thus, how to increase the area of arable land without ecological damage is a problem faced by the whole world. China is the world's most populous country and a traditional agricultural country. Under the pressure of rapid socioeconomic development, China has taken measures to protect its cultivated land from environmental degradation and protect its food security. By reviewing the research literature, we found several ways to increase the area of arable land while protecting this land from damage. We found that natural resources such as marginal and degraded lands could potentially be converted into arable land while still protecting the ecological environment. However, implementation of such a strategy must account for each region's unique ecological and socioeconomic conditions, and will require both support from appropriate policies and ongoing monitoring and support.",

The fossil-bearing deposits, trapped within a depression in the Paleozoic basement, record three episodes of sedimentation formed on floodplains, with an intermediate unit recording a catastrophic deposition through debris flows, probably favored during fast floodings. The integrated approach presented herein supports a change in humidity in central Amazonia through the past 15,000 yr, with a shift from drier to arboreal savanna at 11,340 (±50) 14C yr B.P. and then to a dense forest like we see today at 4620 (±60) 14C yr B.P.",

      "abstract": "The processes initiating the first cooling step of the last greenhouse-to-icehouse transition, from 90 million years ago (Ma) onward still remain enigmatic. While the combination of mountain uplift and continental weathering has been proposed as a major sink for atmospheric CO2 and a climate driver over geological timescales, this hypothesis is much debated and its potential importance in triggering the late Cretaceous global cooling is yet to be explored. In this work, we combined clay mineralogy, trace and major element concentrations, and a new proxy of silicate weathering intensity based on Nd and Hf isotopes (∆ɛHf(t)clay) to explore the potential links between the uplift of the brazilian margin, silicate weathering and climate evolution during the late Cretaceous. Our new ∆ɛHf(t)clay proxy data suggest - for the first time - that marked increase of silicate weathering intensity occurred in southeast Brazil during the late Cretaceous, from ~85 to 70 Ma, related to the tectonic uplift affecting the eastern South American margin at that time. Combined with clay mineralogical analyses, our Hf-Nd isotope data further suggests the existence of a relatively arid local climate during the Turonian-Santonian interval, during which physical disaggregation of rocks most likely prevailed, accompanying the uplift of the Brazilian margin. From the Santonian, we propose that the exposure of new high-elevation regions favored instead locally enhanced precipitations and more hydrolysing conditions, thereby promoting chemical weathering and atmospheric CO2 drawdown. Altogether, our multi-proxy investigation suggests that the uplift of the Brazilian margin could have contributed to the late Cretaceous cooling, potentially playing a key role in the onset of the last greenhouse-to-icehouse transition.",

      "abstract": "The historical development of capitalism created what Karl Marx called a rift in the social metabolism with nature, whereby soil nutrients were systematically siphoned into cities where they were discarded as waste and thus did not return to the land. An alternative mode of food production known as agroecology was developed by different scientists and activists partly to transcend this contradiction. Drawing on data from the United Nations and the World Bank, this work analyzes whether agroecology has contributed to mitigate the metabolic rift in agriculture in Cuba, the country where this approach to food production, adopted after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, is more widely developed. By means of a panel model, both an internal comparison through time within Cuba and a cross-national comparison of Cuba with the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), were developed to determine whether the post-Soviet transition to agroecology in Cuba successfully decoupled industrial agricultural practices from productivity in comparison to other countries in LAC. Decoupling is understood as the removal of the positive correlation between fertilizer use and yield. Synthetic fertilizer use is utilized as an indicator of industrialized agriculture, and productivity of maize and beans as a proxy measure of soil improvement. The model shows a reversal of the fertilizer use and productivity positive correlation in Cuba, where crop productivity has increased while the use of inputs has diminished, which suggests that agroecology has indeed mitigated the metabolic rift produced by industrialized agriculture.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, I argue that the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) mechanism, a globally driven, market-based environmental policy, is racialized in practice. Yet, consideration of how the uptake of these policies is challenged by racialized relations is insufficiently addressed in the neoliberal conservation literature. Colonial histories are sedimented in racialized subjectivities and land management practices where certain economic activities, geographical sites and interactions with the natural environment became the stronghold of different groups. In this paper, I demonstrate how the Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+) mechanism, one such globally driven, market-based environmental policy, is challenged by the legacy of these racialized land use practices and social relations rooted in the defining colonial period in Guyana and Suriname. I outline the relationship between the processes of politically demarcating forests and of shaping subjectivities, drawing attention to how these processes are impacted by REDD+. Through a focus on gold mining, explored here as a historically conditioned, economic relationship with the natural environment, I show how REDD+ contributes to state territorialisation, complicates pre-existing racialized subjectivities and increases the legibility of forests and their amenability to state management.",

      "abstract": "Several assessments of vulnerability and resilience have been attempted at a country level through composite indices but they are barely in accord with a holistic view of sustainable development. We suggest graph theory to structure a network of variables that depict vulnerability and resilience from a sustainable development perspective. Vulnerability is defined as the propensity to incur adverse shocks whereas resilience is the capacity to cope with their negative effects. We identify two control dimensions of vulnerability–resilience (economic and political) and three contingency factors (the social, environmental and the peripheral dimensions). The specificity of the control dimensions is rooted in their impact on all other sides of the pentagon. We propose an algorithm to select the key variables useful in building a composite index that conforms to the structure of these five dimensions while preventing loss of information. An application is provided on Singapore, which has been specified as a typical case of resilience.",

      "abstract": "Blood-sucking insects are important vectors of disease, with biting Diptera (flies) alone transmitting diseases that cause an estimated 700 000 human deaths a year. Insect vectors also bite nonhuman hosts, linking them into host-biting networks. While the major vectors of prominent diseases, such as malaria, yellow fever, dengue, and Zika, are intensively studied, there has been limited focus on the wider interactions of biting insects with nonhuman hosts. Drawing on network analysis and visualisation approaches from food-web ecology, we discuss the value of a network perspective for understanding host–insect–disease interactions, with a focus on Diptera vectors. Potential applications include highlighting pathways of disease transmission, highlighting reservoirs of infection, and identifying emerging and previously unrecognised vectors.",

      "abstract": "The space industry generates pressures on the environment and strives towards more sustainable activities. Several actors of or related to the European space industry, such as ArianeGroup or and the European Space Agency (ESA), have identified the life cycle assessment methodology (LCA) as the most appropriate methodology to measure and then support the reduction of their environmental impact. While the use of the LCA is being established within the sector, only a limited number of peer-reviewed publications are available. Most of the documents released by the stakeholders can be considered to be grey literature. As the topic has not been properly discussed in the literature, there is an opportunity to bring the initiatives carried out by the space sector in recent years to the public domain. Thus, the present work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of past and present studies following the LCA framework. The review compiles 11 papers, conferences proceedings or technical reports that address the development of the LCA framework and good practices in the sector and 27 documents dedicated to LCA studies. On the one hand, the results highlight the emergence of a common framework regarding LCA practice in Europe. On the other hand, the analysed LCA case studies show a highly heterogeneous goal and scope definition. In this review, research needs and methodological challenges are identified and discussed. Finally, recommendations on how to implement and develop the use of LCA within the space industry are given in view of designing more sustainable space systems and associated missions.",

      "abstract": "The main goal of the present study was to test if two sympatric species of Heliconia, Heliconia spathocircinata and Heliconia laneana var. flava, differ in their reproductive seasons and guilds of flower visitors. Twenty-four sampling sessions were conducted monthly between February 2001 and January 2003. Individuals of H. spathocircinata and of H. laneana var. flava were tagged within a transect of 4000×4m. Reproductive phenophases (flowering, unripe, and ripe fruits) were recorded, and circular statistics were used to test for the regularity and frequency of phenophases. Flower visitors were observed during two flowering periods for each species. Both species had well-defined and synchronous reproductive periods, with a small overlap, suggesting a sequential flowering model. Biotic and abiotic factors seem to affect phenophases of both species. However, herbarium data suggest that the flowering period in H. spathocircinata varies less than in H. laneana, despite its wider geographic distribution. The hummingbird Phaethornis idaliae was the main floral visitor of both Heliconia species studied. H. laneana was also legitimately visited by another hummingbird species, Glaucis hirsuta, and by Lepidoptera. Some Lepidoptera, particularly the bee Trigona spinipes, were illegitimate visitors (‘nectar robbers’). We suggest that the flower of H. spathocircinata allowed a wider array of visitors, because it is bigger.",

      "abstract": "The notion of ‘food sovereignty’ is often surprisingly absent in food and agricultural discourses in the Anglo-Caribbean, where over the past half century policy-making has aligned with conventional ‘food security’ approaches. This paper argues that, in addition to its contemporary entrenchment within a neoliberal environment, this is also due to the nature of ‘sovereignty’ itself in a region which has been shaped by a distinctive colonial, social and economic history. In order to demonstrate this, firstly, it makes the case for why, in the context of rising food imports and enduring structural legacies, food sovereignty matters in the Anglo-Caribbean. Secondly, it charts changes in the regional policy of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) to show how, despite repeated calls to increase self-sufficiency, conventional neoliberal approaches to agricultural development and food security have predominated since the 1970s. Finally, it identifies and analyses limited instances where food sovereignty discourses have been mobilized, by farmers’ groups and political actors, and interrogates the meaning of both ‘internal’ and ‘external’ sovereignty itself in this post-colonial context. It finds mobilisations of food sovereignty to be characterised by a repeated conflation of domestic food production with the concept’s ideological principles as a political project, and a particular understanding of sovereignty that places an emphasis on ‘the state’ and ‘the region’ over ‘the people’. This shows that the very nature of ‘sovereignty’ itself plays a critical role in both the translation of, and possibilities for mobilising ‘food sovereignty’ as a radical project as envisaged in the wider literature.",

      "abstract": "The tribe Empidini (Diptera: Empididae: Empidinae) is a diverse group with fourteen genera, seven of which are exclusive to the Neotropical region: Bolrhamphomyia Rafael, Chilerhamphomyia Rafael, Hystrichonotus Collin, Lamprempis Wheeler and Melander, Macrostomus Wiedemann, Opeatocerata Melander and Porphyrochroa Melander. Although Empidini itself is likely paraphyletic, many presumably monophyletic genera and species groups are recognized. Here, we apply DNA sequences from multiple genes to infer the phylogeny of Empidini, focusing on placing the Neotropical lineages within the entire tribe and identifying monophyletic groups. We included 98 Empidini taxa along with 18 outgrous terminals, spanning the diversity within the group. The results from the analyses performed are largely similar, with major groupings of genera in common. Specifically, the analyses recovered a monophyletic Hilarini and a paraphyletic Empidini. Most species from Chile and Argentina (Andean region) are found to belong to an early branching lineage within Empidinae, and are not monophyletic with other Empidini. A large portion of the remaining Neotropical Empidini (not Andean) comprises a single clade that includes four endemic genera and a number of Neotropical Empis Linneaus species. Macrostomus and Porphyrochroa each recovered as monophyletic and sister to one another, although generic placement of a few taxa remains uncertain due to conflicting morphological features. Lamprempis+Opeatocerata are also found to be sister-taxa in most analyses. Several large genera were found to be polyphyletic or paraphyletic including Empis and Rhamphomyia Meigen. We evaluate our findings and discuss them in light of current Empidinae taxonomy.",

      "abstract": "The rapidly growing human population in West Africa has generated increasing demand for agricultural land and forest products. Consequently 90% of the original rainforest cover has now disappeared and the remainder is heavily fragmented and highly degraded. Although many studies have focused on carbon stocks and fluxes in intact African forests, little information exists on biomass recovery rates in secondary forests. We studied a chronosequence of 96 secondary and old-growth forest fragments (0.2 ha each) where 32.103 trees with Diameter at Breast Height >2.5 cm have been censused. We modelled the biomass recovery trajectories in a time-explicit Bayesian framework and tested the effect on recovery rates of a large set of covariates related to the physical environment, plot history, and forest connectivity. Recovery rate trajectory is highly non-linear: recovery rates accelerated from 1 to 37 years, when biomass recovery reached 4.23 Mg·ha−1·yr−1, and decelerated afterwards. We predict that, on average, 10%, 25% and 50% of the old-growth forest biomass is respectively recovered 17, 30, and 51 years after abandonment. Recovery rates are strongly shaped by both the number of remnant trees (residuals of the former old-growth forest) and the previous crop cultivated before abandonment. The latter induced large differences in the time needed to recover 50% of an old-growth forest biomass: from 38 years for former Yam fields up to 86 years for former rice fields. Our results emphasize (i) the very slow recovery rates of West African forests, as compared to Neotropical forests (ii) the long-lasting impacts of past human activities and management choices on ecosystem biomass recovery in West African degraded forests.",

      "abstract": "Damming has exerted far-reaching and profound impacts on ecological functions in river ecosystems. However, the “damming effects” on greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from tributaries of reservoirs in subtropical region were largely overlooked. In this study, we assessed the GHG fluxes (CH4, CO2 and N2O) from air–water interface and the related factors in Xiangxi River of Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) region over one year. The annual average fluxes of CH4, CO2 and N2O from Xiangxi River were 0.13±0.11mgm−2h−1, 16.01±23.21mgm−2h−1 and 21.57±12.75μgm−2h−1, respectively, which were significantly lower than those from tropical rivers or lakes. The GHG fluxes showed strong seasonal dynamics: CH4 was consistently released to the atmosphere and was more in summer than the other seasons. CO2 was absorbed from the atmosphere in spring, but was emitted the most in winter. N2O flux was higher in cold season than in warm season. Additionally, CH4 emission showed obvious spatial variations that decreased gradually from shallow to deep water-level areas. Correlation analysis demonstrated that CH4 emission was negatively correlated with water depth and air–water temperature difference, and positively with air temperature. CO2 flux was negatively related to chlorophyll a (Chl. a) and N2O flux was negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen (DO). The present study will deepen our understanding of Three Gorges Dam (TGD) construction impacts on GHG emissions in the tributaries, and help us to better estimate GHG emissions for TGR.",

Here, we describe epidemiological and diagnostic characteristics of all returning travellers diagnosed with leptospirosis in the Netherlands between 2009 and 2016. Furthermore, we present a detailed clinical case series of all travellers with leptospirosis who presented at the Academic Medical Center (AMC) in the same period.\nMethod\nWe extracted data from the records of the Dutch Leptospirosis Reference Center (NRL) of all cases of leptospirosis in travellers in the Netherlands from 2009 to 2016. Patients who presented at the AMC were identified and clinical data were extracted from the hospital records.\nResults\n224 cases of travel-related leptospirosis were included. An increase of cases was observed from 2014 onwards. The majority of cases were male (78.1%), and had travelled to South-East Asia (62.1%). Of 41 AMC cases, 53.7% were hospitalised, but most patients had a relatively mild disease course, with no fatalities. A longer delay in diagnosis and treatment initiation existed in hospitalised compared to non-hospitalised patients, suggesting a benefit of early recognition and treatment.\nConclusions\nLeptospirosis was increasingly observed in returning travellers in the Netherlands, and is a diagnosis that should be considered in any returning febrile traveller.",

      "abstract": "Carbon storage is one of the main objectives for mangrove afforestation. Planting of the exotic species Sonneratia apetala can rapidly increase the mangrove area and biomass. Here, we studied the change in vegetation and the soil carbon stocks along the chronosequence of S. apetala plantations in Qi'ao Island, China. Five sites, including rehabilitated S. apetala of different ages (1, 4, 9, and 15 years) and 40-year-old mature native Kandelia obovata forests were investigated. Vegetation biomass and the soil carbon content from 0 to 100 cm were analyzed. The ecosystem carbon density (vegetation and soil) was then calculated. A positive and linear relationship was observed between the vegetation carbon stocks and age of S. apetala. The 15-year-old S. apetala already had a similar biomass to 40-year-old K. obovata. However, its soil and ecosystem carbon densities remained lower than those of K. obovata. Different from K. obovata, the majority of the biomass of S. apetala was reserved within the stem. Mature K. obovata had a larger proportion of soil carbon stock to ecosystem carbon stock. S. apetala can accumulate biomass rapidly, but it had a lower ecosystem carbon stock than the native mature K. obovata.",

      "abstract": "The vast tropical rainforest in Amazonia, once presumed a virgin wilderness vulnerable to climate forcing and inimical to indigenous cultures, is now shown by prehistoric, ethnographic, and ethnohistoric data to be almost the opposite: a human habitat resilient to environment change but much influenced by thousands of years of occupation. The earliest foragers quickly penetrated the region ca. 13,000 years cal BP, leaving traces far and wide. The first villages, ca. 4000 years cal BP later, created substantial shell-middens and disturbances in nearby forest areas. After another 4000 years cal BP in many regions, people turned to shifting horticulture, cutting and burning fields, disseminating crops, and planting trees. In the last 3000 years of prehistory, networks of populous, warring chiefdoms established nucleated centers along floodplains and trade routes, creating mound complexes, defense works, fields, orchards, and refuse heaps that greatly altered topography, soils, and vegetation. Some settlements grew to urban proportions during the last 1000 years of prehistory, leaving large earth mounds of rich black cultural refuse. Their effects altered habitats widely but not destructively in terms of resources for human use. European invaders defeated the chiefdoms, decimated their populations, and pushed survivors to the peripheries. Post-colonial states continued forced migration and deculturation and instituted destructive industries, destroying valuable timberlands, bulldozing orchards, shell mounds, anthropic forests, and archeological sites, polluting waters, and causing wide erosion and savannization. These changes threaten the integrity and continuity of the Amazon cultural ecological system and linked ecosystems beyond it.",

      "abstract": "The available palynological evidence allows reconstruction of the principal trends in the historical biogeography and evolution of the neotropical palm genus Mauritia. Its pollen is known from the Palaeocene, and has been widespread throughout the entire neotropical region, during the Tertiary. From the Late Miocene until the Pleistocene, populations have been progressively fragmented by the Andean orogeny, thus promoting local extinction in some smaller basins and allopatric speciation in others. During the Pleistocene, Mauritia survived the repeated dry and cool periods characteristic for glaciations either by restricting its distribution to assumed Amazon forest ‘refugia’ or by forming large-scale, heterogeneous forest communities. After the last glaciation, palynological studies document a broad dispersal process of Mauritia, leading to its present range. However, Holocene climatic shifts, together with human disturbance, created a heterogeneous distribution pattern with spatial and temporal differences within this process. Therefore, biogeographical inferences based on present-day observations can only account for the most recent changes and are not suitable for generalizations. The history of Mauritia derived from the fossil record suggests opportunities for both vicariance and allopatric speciation, and reveals dispersal patterns through time. The presence of Mauritia in sediments can also be used as a reliable indicator of warm tropical lowland environments flooded by fresh (occasionally oligohalyne) waters. Several hypothesis about its biogeographical history and its palaeoecological implications are offered that can be tested with future studies.",

      "abstract": "Vertical volume emission rate profiles of the OH(3–1) Meinel emission near the mesopause are retrieved from nighttime limb-emission observations with the SCIAMACHY (Scanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY) instrument on the Envisat satellite. Mean emission altitudes are determined by weighting altitude with the vertical OH(3–1) volume emission rate profile. Analysis of the SCIAMACHY data set from January 2003 to December 2011 shows a clear semi-annual variation of the mean emission altitudes at low latitudes – where SCIAMACHY performs measurements throughout the year – with an amplitude of 0.5–1.0km. Confirming earlier studies, we find a near constant, or universal, scaling of mean OH emission altitude and vertically integrated emission rate, which can be employed by ground-based observers to infer indirect information on OH emission altitude and its variability, if measurements of OH emission rates are performed. For this purpose we provide climatological fit parameters for the altitude/emission rate relationship. No obvious long-term trends or 11-year solar cycle signatures are present in the OH emission altitude time series, partly contradicting earlier studies. The long-term stability in OH emission altitude at the local time of the SCIAMACHY nighttime observations (10 p.m.) strengthens the use of ground-based OH rotational temperature measurements to study middle atmospheric climate change.",

      "abstract": "Large dams built for hydroelectric power generation alter the hydrology of rivers, attenuating the flood pulse downstream of the dam and impacting riparian and floodplain ecosystems. The present work mapped black-water floodplain forests (igapó) downstream of the Balbina Reservoir, which was created between 1983 and 1987 by damming the Uatumã River in the Central Amazon basin. We apply remote sensing methods to detect tree mortality resulting from hydrological changes, based on analysis of 56 ALOS/PALSAR synthetic aperture radar images acquired at different flood levels between 2006 and 2011. Our application of object-based image analysis (OBIA) methods and the random forests supervised classification algorithm yielded an overall accuracy of 87.2%. A total of 9800 km2 of igapó forests were mapped along the entire river downstream of the dam, but forest mortality was only observed below the first 49 km downstream, after the Morena rapids, along an 80-km river stretch. In total, 12% of the floodplain forest died within this stretch. We also detected that 29% of the remaining living igapó forest may be presently undergoing mortality. Furthermore, this large loss does not include the entirety of lost igapó forests downstream of the dam; areas which are now above current maximum flooding heights are no longer floodable and do not show on our mapping but will likely transition over time to upland forest species composition and dynamics, also characteristic of igapó loss. Our results show that floodplain forests are extremely sensitive to long-term downstream hydrological changes and disturbances resulting from the disruption of the natural flood pulse. Brazilian hydropower regulations should require that Amazon dam operations ensure the simulation of the natural flood-pulse, despite losses in energy production, to preserve the integrity of floodplain forest ecosystems and to mitigate impacts for the riverine populations.",

      "abstract": "A morpho-sedimentary analysis of the Ayeyarwady delta shoreline was conducted based on a field mission in Myanmar in November 2016 and interpretation of satellite images spanning the period 1974–2019. These analyses were complemented by data on land-to-water conversion and vice versa within a 2 km-wide coastal fringe, and on MERIS-derived seasonal and decadal-scale evolution of suspended particulate matter (SPM) off the delta. The objectives were to: (1) characterize the 450 km-long delta shoreline and coastal sediment transport pathways, (2) define the shoreline status (stability, erosion, accretion), and (3) identify potential causes of shoreline change and the future outcome of this status in terms of delta vulnerability. The delta shoreline was characterized on the basis of qualitative alongshore tidal, wave-energy, and sediment grain-size patterns (muddy, sandy or a mixture of both), and morphology (sandy beaches and mudflats). The deltaic coast exhibits a mixed wave-and-tide-dominated morphology and comprises a western sector characterized by four of the five main distributary mouths separating inter-distributary plains bounded by low overwash-influenced beaches devoid of aeolian dunes. The eastern sector, in the Gulf of Martaban, is embayed, much less prograded and bounded by dominantly muddy shores. This simple shoreline dichotomy reflects the overarching alongshore sediment redistribution and storage patterns that have accompanied the growth of the delta, resulting in the two facies: sand dominantly retained in the western sector where the multiple distributary mouths have constrained potential alongshore sand transport by low- to moderate-energy monsoon-generated southwesterly waves, and mud transported by the regional monsoon-influenced coastal shelf circulation towards the eastern sector. The recent multi-decadal shoreline mobility in the Ayeyarwady delta points to the influence of fluvial sediment supply on these two facies. Between 1974 and 2019, 49% of the delta's shoreline underwent erosion, mainly affecting the sandy beaches in the western sector, whereas shoreline accretion is still prevalent along the large inter-distributary plain east of Yangon, where coastal mud preferentially accumulates in the Gulf of Martaban. We attribute erosion to reduced river sand supply generated by dams and by massive in-channel sand mining upstream of the delta, exacerbated by important channel dredging. Large-scale deforestation resulting from land-use changes (agriculture and mining) in the Ayeyarwady catchment are probably contributing to enhanced fine-grained sediment supply to the delta plain and the coast, as reflected by the relative stability of coastal SPM over a decade (2002–2012) and continued deposition in the accreting eastern sheltered part of the delta. The coastal sediment balance will be further impacted in the future if planned dams are constructed. Without proper sediment management, notably a significant reduction or prohibition of in-channel sand mining, the sandy beaches that armour the wave-exposed western sector of the delta will continue to erode, resulting in increased potential exposure of the delta to cyclones and sea-level rise.",

      "abstract": "Insects, particularly ants, are good bioindicators of the state of ecosystems. Nevertheless, incorporating them into conservation surveys is expensive due to problems associated with their identification, which is exacerbated by the fact that there are fewer and fewer taxonomists working today. “Taxonomic sufficiency” (TS), which identifies organisms to a level of taxonomic resolution sufficient enough to satisfy the objectives of a study, has never been applied to Neotropical ant communities. We analysed five Neotropical datasets representing ant assemblages collected with different sampling methods in various habitats. We first treated them using two complementary and cumulative TS methods, higher-taxon and “indicator taxa” surrogacies, before testing a new approach called “mixed-level method” that combines the two previous approaches. For the higher-taxon surrogacy, we showed that, above species, genus is the most informative taxonomic level. Then, mixed-level method provided more information on ant assemblages than did the two others, even though the “indicator taxa” surrogacy was based on relevant indicator genera. Although habitat type has no effect on its efficiency, this new method is influenced by the dataset structure and the type of sampling method used to collect data. We have thus developed a new method for analyzing Neotropical ant faunas that enables the taxonomic work linked to the identification of problematic species to be significantly reduced, while conserving most of the information on the ant assemblage. This method should enhance the work of Neotropical entomologists not specialised in taxonomy, particularly those concerned with biological conservation and indication.",

      "abstract": "The present work deals with determination groundwater flows in the Amazon region, based on analysis of geothermal data acquired in shallow and deep wells. The method employed is based on the model of simultaneous heat transfer by conduction and advection in permeable media. Analysis of temperature data acquired in water wells indicates down flows of groundwaters with velocities in excess of 10−7m/s at depths less than 300m in the Amazonas basin. Bottom-hole temperature (BHT) data sets have been used in determining characteristics of fluid movements at larger depths in the basins of Acre, Solimões, Amazonas, Marajó and Barreirinhas. The results of model simulations point to down flow of groundwaters with velocities of the order of 10−8 to 10−9m/s, at depths of up to 4000m. No evidence has been found for up flow typical of discharge zones. The general conclusion compatible with such results is that large-scale groundwater recharge systems operate at both shallow and deep levels in all sedimentary basins of the Amazon region. However, the basement rock formations of the Amazon region are relatively impermeable and hence extensive down flow systems through the sedimentary strata are possible only in the presence of generalized lateral movement of groundwater in the basal parts of the sedimentary basins. The direction of this lateral flow, inferred from the basement topography and geological characteristics of the region, is from west to east, following roughly the course of surface drainage system of the Amazon River, with eventual discharge into the Atlantic Ocean. The estimated flow rate at the continental margin is 3287m3/s, with velocities of the order of 218m/year. It is possible that dynamic changes in the fluvial systems in the western parts of South American continent have been responsible for triggering alterations in the groundwater recharge systems and deep seated lateral flows in the Amazon region.",

      "abstract": "Protected areas (PAs) are dedicated and managed to achieve long-term conservation of nature with associated ecosystem services and cultural values. However, few studies have assessed contamination/pollution, one of the top five biodiversity threats, within these areas. In fact, more than 100,000 molecules used in consumer goods are potentially affecting over 250,000 protected areas distributed worldwide. As a result, chemical appraisal within PAs require specific approaches to be feasible. Herein, an approach for assessment of contamination in marine protected areas (MPAs) spread over large continental and/or global areas was proposed and tested using, as a case study, the impact of tributyltin (TBT) within Latin America. This approach included area delimitation, bibliographic survey, construction of attribute tables, data insertion in a Geographic Information System, overlapping with worldwide shapefiles of PAs, identification of affected PAs and evaluation of impacts using the outcomes against specific environmental quality guidelines/directives. A total of 259 records of TBT occurrence and/or its biological effect within 53 marine protected areas (including biosphere reserves, Ramsar sites and National parks) were gathered. Among affected species, were recorded 18 gastropods exhibiting imposex. In addition, 6 bivalves, 1 crustacean, and 3 fish species presenting TBT residues in tissues were seen in MPAs from Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, Chile and Venezuela. Since levels of TBT recorded in several studied MPAs were enough do induce deleterious biological responses over marine biota, it was clear that conservancy goals of some “protected” areas are under threat. Considering that only TBT exposure was appraised, and these areas are likely to be concomitantly exposed to other classes of contaminants, the actual scenario can be even more frightening. Although initially applied as a TBT case study, the present approach enables an overview for other chemicals within protected areas worldwide.",

Relatively dense waters (compared to those in the deep Caribbean) from the North Atlantic spill over this sill to ventilate the deep Caribbean Sea. Deep warming at a rate of over 0.01°Cdecade–1 below this sill depth appears to have commenced in the 1970s after a period of relatively constant deep Caribbean Sea temperatures extending at least as far back as the 1920s. Conductivity–temperature–depth station data from World Ocean Circulation Experiment Section A22 along 66°W taken in 1997 and again in 2003 provide an especially precise, albeit geographically limited, estimate of this warming over that 6-year period. They also suggest a small (0.001 PSS-78, about the size of expected measurement biases) deep freshening. The warming is about 10 times larger than the size of geothermal heating in the region, and is of the same magnitude as the average global upper-ocean heat uptake over a recent 50-year period. Together with the freshening, the warming contributes about 0.012mdecade–1 of sea level rise in portions of the Caribbean Sea with bottom depths around 5000m.",

      "abstract": "Tree growth and mortality are two central processes in mixed and structurally complex moist tropical forests, yet accurate estimates of the variables needed to model them remain sparse and scattered. It is thus still difficult to predict forest evolution at a local scale and build reliable management plans. To help fill this gap, for 1–7 years we annually monitored 21,180 trees belonging to 42 species exploited for timber production in Central Africa. We made new species-specific estimates of diameter increments and mortality rates, and investigated how tree growth varied with tree size and logging history. We compared our results with the legal values of diameter increments, mortality rates, and minimum cutting diameters used to build forest management plans in Cameroon. Diameter increment was found to vary with tree size for most of the species studied. The relationships between diameter increment and tree size were mostly humpback-shaped. The trees with diameters close to or lower than the reference minimum cutting diameter generally grew faster than the average. We also found that tree growth could slow for 1–2 years after timber exploitation and was then spurred for at least 5 years. The tree growth response to logging was nevertheless species-specific. This study provides new estimates of tree diameter increments and mortality rates that could help make more accurate forest projections and draw up sustainable management plans in Africa.",

      "abstract": "To develop solar energy as a primary source of electricity supply in China, it is imperative to also develop an overall and complete solar energy potential analysis. Such an analysis technique would be a substantial contribution to solar power generation development both nationally and regionally. This study analyzes the spatial and temporal distribution of solar energy in China and estimates the solar energy potential from three aspects: geography, technology, and economy. The results of this research showed that the solar energy resource in China is substantially rich and stable, but also has notable spatial heterogeneity. A potential estimation indicated that Xinjiang Province was the most optimal site for large-scale photovoltaic station construction, displaying the highest values for all three potentials. It was also found that solar energy potential in western China is greater, while the eastern region is less suitable for solar photovoltaic development. These results can provide support for the large-scale development and utilization of solar energy resources in the future.",

      "abstract": "Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a reliable biomarker of pesticide exposure although in clams this activity is often very low or undetectable. Carboxylesterases (CEs) exhort several physiological roles, but also respond to pesticides. Searching for an AChE alternative, baseline CE activities were characterised in Ruditapes decussatus gills and digestive glands using five substrates suggestive of different isozymes. The long chain p-nitrophenyl butyrate and 1-naphthyl butyrate were the most sensitive. In the digestive gland, their kinetic parameters (Vmax and Km) and in vitro sensitivity to the organophosphorus metabolite chlorpyrifos oxon (CPX) were calculated. IC50 values, in the pM–nM range, suggest a high protection efficiency of CE-related enzymes towards CPX neurotoxicity. Other targeted enzymes were: activities of glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and lactate dehydrogenase in gills and digestive glands. The high GSTs activity and CE/AChE ratio suggests that R. decussatus has a great capacity for enduring pesticide exposure.",

      "abstract": "We inferred the phylogenetic relationships, divergence time and biogeography of Conopophagidae (gnateaters) based on sequence data of mitochondrial genes (ND2, ND3 and cytb) and nuclear introns (TGFB2 and G3PDH) from 45 tissue samples (43 Conopophaga and 2 Pittasoma) representing all currently recognized species of the family and the majority of subspecies. Phylogenetic relationships were estimated by maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference. Divergence time estimates were obtained based on a Bayesian relaxed clock model. These chronograms were used to calculate diversification rates and reconstruct ancestral areas of the genus Conopophaga. The phylogenetic analyses support the reciprocal monophyly of the two genera, Conopophaga and Pittasoma. All species were monophyletic with the exception of C. lineata, as C. lineata cearae did not cluster with the other two C. lineata subspecies. Divergence time estimates for Conopophagidae suggested that diversification took place during the Neogene, and that the diversification rate within Conopophaga clade was highest in the late Miocene, followed by a slower diversification rate, suggesting a diversity-dependent pattern. Our analyses of the diversification of family Conopophagidae provided a scenario for evolution in Terra Firme forest across tropical South America. The spatio-temporal pattern suggests that Conopophaga originated in the Brazilian Shield and that a complex sequence of events possibly related to the Andean uplift and infilling of former sedimentation basins and erosion cycles shaped the current distribution and diversity of this genus.",

This incredibly diverse order includes members inhabiting every continent, either naturally or in human-made environments. While rodents have been the cause or implicated in disease transmission that has lead to human pandemics, such as the Black Death, and the decimation of certain animal species, like island-dwelling birds; genetically modified rodents have contributed significantly to the advancement of biomedical research and human health. There are more than 50 species of endangered rats, mice, voles, squirrels, and marmots. The recent extinction of the Bramble Cay melomys represents the first human-induced rodent extinction linked to climate change. Rodents are the reservoir host of several human and domestic pathogens of concern listed by OIE.

Subtypes are shorelines of permanent rivers with fluctuating water level, seasonal pools in climates with variations in rainfall and the ephemeral flush habitat on inselbergs. EW offer extreme environments, shifting from flooding to water shortage. Short-lived annuals, dwarfish perennials and resurrections plants find a niche there. A permanent seed bank (and egg bank for crustaceans) buffers the year-to-year variability. Strong selective forces result in evolutionary processes like convergence, niche constancy, endemism and vicariance of taxa. By sheltering rare and endemic species, EW are jewels of biodiversity.",

      "abstract": "Sea surface temperature (SST) can influence the phytoplankton biomass, measured as sea surface chlorophyll concentration (SSCC), by affecting the physical and chemical properties of the seawater, living environment, and the consumption of zooplankton in a complex way. Yet, the quantitative assessment of the spatiotemporal variation of the inherent synchronous association between SSCC and SST at large spatial and temporal scales is still lacking. Accordingly, in the present study a synthetic approach was proposed that combines wavelet coherency analysis (WCA) with Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) modeling and hotspot analysis in order to evaluate the association between SSCC and SST globally during the period July 2002-February 2019. The WCA-based statistical results showed that SSCC has strong association with SST; particularly strong synchronous variations between SSCC and SST were found at the 1-year and the 5-year periods. During the 1-year period, cluster characteristics were explored in the BME-generated space–time maps of the association strength as well as in the corresponding hotspot maps. Geographically, high association strengths between SSCC and SST were detected in the mid-latitude regions of the Pacific Ocean, in the south and north of the tropical regions of the Atlantic Ocean, and in the southern part of the Indian Ocean. Temporally, most of the sub-regions exhibited a stable level of association strength during the entire study period (only a few sub-regions exhibited fluctuations or a slightly decreasing association strength trend). In conclusion, by assimilating the available knowledge bases at each grid point the proposed synthetic approach assessed quantitatively the strength of the periodic association between SSCC and SST globally; and the approach could be employed to map the space–time variation of the association strength between related natural attributes in the space–time-frequency domain.",

      "abstract": "Rodents are the most diversified mammalian order (484 extant genera including 2277 species), and they have a worldwide distribution. Palaeontological, morphological and molecular data have greatly helped to resolve their systematics and evolutionary history. However, some discrepancies remain between palaeontologists and molecular biologists. New techniques in molecular biology, and especially in palaeogenetics, allow us to have direct access to the hereditary material of extinct organisms, and they can compensate for some morphological limits. Unfortunately, few studies are dealing with rodent palaeogenetics, despite the amount of museum and fossil material available. Here, we review the major research activities in rodent palaeogenetics (phylogeny, genetic diversity, migration), and we present the promising research perspectives in this field (phylochronology, palaeoparasitology).\nRésumé\nParmi les Mammifères, l’ordre des Rongeurs est de loin le mieux représenté (484 genres, comprenant 2277 espèces) à travers le monde. L’histoire évolutive et la systématique de ce groupe ont largement été étudiées par le biais de données paléontologiques, morphologiques et moléculaires. Cependant, il persiste certains points de désaccord entre paléontologistes et biologistes moléculaires. L’avancée des techniques de biologie moléculaire, et particulièrement en paléogénétique, permet désormais d’accéder au patrimoine génétique d’organismes disparus depuis plusieurs milliers d’années, mais aussi de pallier certaines limites de la morphologie. Malheureusement, peu de travaux se rapportant aux rongeurs intègrent des données paléogénétiques, malgré l’importante quantité de fossiles et de matériel conservés dans les musées. Nous présentons ici une synthèse des travaux effectués en paléogénétique (phylogénie, diversité génétique, migration) depuis l’origine de la discipline, ainsi que les champs disciplinaires prometteurs dans ce domaine (phylochronologie, paléoparasitologie).",

      "abstract": "Rainfall erosivity is the driving factor for soil erosion and can be potentially affected by climate change, impacting agriculture and the environment. In this study, we sought to project the impact of climate change on the long-term average annual rainfall erosivity (R-factor) and mean annual precipitation in South America. The CanESM2, HadGEM2-ES, and MIROC5 global circulation models (GCMs) and the average of the GCMs (GCM-Ensemble) downscaled by the Eta/CPTEC model at a spatial resolution of 20 km in the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5 were applied in this study. A geographical model to estimate the R-factor across South America was fitted. This model was based on latitude, longitude, altitude, and mean annual precipitation as inputs obtained from the WorldClim database. Using this model, the first R-factor map for South America was developed (for the baseline period: 1961–2005). The GCMs projected mean annual precipitation for three 30-year time periods (time slices: 2010–2040; 2041–2070; 2071–2099). These projections were used to run the R-factor model to assess the impact of climate change. It was observed that the changes were more pronounced in the Amazon Forest region (namely, the North Region, NR, and the Andes North Region, ANR) with a strong reduction in the mean annual precipitation and R-factor throughout the century. The highest increase in the R-factor was projected on the Central and South Andes regions (CAR and SAR) because of the increase in the mean annual precipitation projected by the GCMs. The GCMs pointed contradictory projections for the Central-South Region (CSR), indicating greater uncertainty. An increase in the R-factor was projected for this region, eastern Argentina, and southern Brazil, whereas a decrease in the R-factor was expected for southeastern Brazil. In general, the GCMs projected reductions in the R-factor and annual precipitation for South America, with the highest changes projected from the baseline to the 2010–2040 time slice.",

      "abstract": "Production of French Polynesia's black pearls is entirely dependent on oceanic conditions. Yet, conditions are changing due to climate change. This research evaluates the potential economic consequences of increased seawater temperature on black pearl production. A stochastic-dynamic bioeconomic simulation simulated the growth of oysters and pearl quality under current and projected seawater temperatures in 2035 in the Northern Tuamotu Archipelago. Production strategies, including grafting intensity, grafting timeframe, and overall pearl quality distribution were included in the simulation to identify production strategies which maximized net present value (NPV) over ten-years. Across all simulated management scenarios, production occurring under projected seawater temperatures resulted in an average decline of 29.1% in expected NPV. Overall, the change in expected NPV stemmed from a decline in the quantity of pearls produced, decline in the quality of pearls produced, and an increase in time between production stages. The optimal production strategy for current and projected seawater temperatures across all management scenarios was to graft a whole cohort of oysters in December with the best possible pearl quality distribution. However, with production occurring with other pearl quality distributions, optimal grafting timeframe and intensity differs between temperature regimes. Aligning production strategies with seawater temperatures can ameliorate economic losses.",

      "abstract": "Tropical forests are facing threats that may affect the dynamics of seed dispersers which participate in the forest regeneration. To implement appropriate conservation programs, it appears necessary to monitor seed dispersers and to estimate their response to local changes. Here, we used non-invasive ecoacoustic methods to monitor the activity of a canopy bird, the White-throated toucan, Ramphastos tucanus, a major seed disperser and flagship species of the Amazonian forest. We deployed nine acoustic recorders over 29 days along a road that connects French Guiana to Brazil. We used template matching to automatically detect the vocalizations of R. tucanus. This method, which can easily be repeated with limited human expertise, detected 1748 recordings with R. tucanus vocalizations. A GLMM analysis was applied to test for a possible effect of habitat type and human activity, while accounting for time of the day and rainfall. The number of vocalizations varied according to time of the day with peaks at dawn and dusk. The number of vocalizations did not differ significantly among sites, they were not affected by habitat type, and they were only marginally influenced by human activity. These results indicate that the vocal activity of a key conservation species can be monitored automatically in a non-invasive way. The species targeted, R. tucanus, does not seem to be significantly impacted by the road and local human activity. This might be related to the mobility of the species, which can easily cross the road, as well as low local forestry pressure.",

      "abstract": "The remineralization of organic carbon (OC) in marine sediments has crucial implications for global carbon cycling and climate change. However, OC turnover rates differ significantly owing to complex spatiotemporal variations in sediment depositional conditions. This review discusses the dominant methodologies through laboratory or in situ methods to measure oxygen consumption or dissolved inorganic carbon production rates to assess OC remineralization rates. The influencing factors in marine sediments are briefly described, including characteristics of OC interactions with the sediment matrix, redox effect, temperature, and biotic activities. Lastly, we provide a comparison of the OC remineralization rates among near-shore (0–50 m), continental shelf and slope (50–2000 m), deep sea (2000–6000 m), and trench (>6000 m) sediments. The remineralization rates generally decreased with distance from the continent, excluding the trench region. While conditions such as redox oscillation, nutrient input, and temperature were severely influenced by global warming and human activities on large scales, reactions between OC and degradation functional genes of microorganisms helped to reveal the microbial scale of sedimentary OC remineralization. Thus, it is pivotal to understand both the processes of OC remineralization and the underlying mechanisms in marine sediments.",

      "abstract": "Tree mode of death provides insights as to why soil and topography explain only about 25% of the spatial variation in tree mortality in Central Amazonia, and permit predictions about what types of mortality are most probable under climate change. We studied tree mortality by mode of death in 72 1-ha permanent plots spanning 64km2 of tropical moist forest in Reserva Ducke, Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil. Plots were re-censused twice (2003–2005 and 2005–2008). Tree mode of death was assigned for trees ⩾4cm dbh as standing, uprooted or snapped. We also recorded whether trees died alone or were pushed over by treefalls. Standing death was predominant, representing 54% of deaths of trees with dbh⩾10cm, followed by snapping (26%) and uprooting (14%). Trees that fell alone represented 25% of deaths, while 16% were pushed over. Most small fallen dead trees (4⩽dbh<30cm) were pushed over by other trees, while most large dead trees (dbh⩾30cm) died alone. Standing mortality was weakly related to soil and topography, but 20% of variation in uprooted mortality and 11% in snapped mortality of trees with dbh⩾10cm was explained by soil and topography. The variation in mortality explained for small trees (18% for uprooted mortality and 13% for snapped mortality) was higher than for large trees (14% for mortality by snapping only). In spite of little variation in mortality associated directly with soil and slope, analyses assessing the effect of topographic categories (plateaux, slope, and valley) on tree mortality detected higher differences, even though causal factors remain unidentified because topographic position may encompass both topographic and soil properties. There was an increase from the first to the second census interval in the effects associated with soil and topography on tree mortality by uprooting and snapping, and this was likely due to storms, which led to a disproportional increase in tree mortality for these tree modes of death. Presently, uprooting and snapping mortality are not dominant and the use of soil and topographic variables for modeling of tree mortality is therefore limited. However, under predicted climate-change scenarios of higher frequency of extreme storms, soil and topography may become more useful to improve estimates of tree mortality and biomass losses over large areas in Amazonia.",

      "abstract": "The ongoing coronavirus disease 19s pandemic has yet again demonstrated the importance of the human-animal interface in the emergence of zoonotic diseases, and in particular the role of wildlife and livestock species as potential hosts and virus reservoirs. As most diseases emerge out of the human-animal interface, a better understanding of the specific drivers and mechanisms involved is crucial to prepare for future disease outbreaks. Interactions between wildlife and livestock systems contribute to the emergence of zoonotic diseases, especially in the face of globalization, habitat fragmentation and destruction and climate change. As several groups of viruses and bacteria are more likely to emerge, we focus on pathogenic viruses of the Bunyavirales, Coronaviridae, Flaviviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, and Paramyxoviridae, as well as bacterial species including Mycobacterium sp., Brucella sp., Bacillus anthracis and Coxiella burnetii. Noteworthy, it was difficult to predict the drivers of disease emergence in the past, even for well-known pathogens. Thus, an improved surveillance in hotspot areas and the availability of fast, effective, and adaptable control measures would definitely contribute to preparedness. We here propose strategies to mitigate the risk of emergence and/or re-emergence of prioritized pathogens to prevent future epidemics.",

The results of this case study illustrate the cost effectiveness of alternative land-use options that reduce deforestation and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This analysis demonstrates that using Guyana's rainforests for climate change mitigation can generate equivalent revenue to that of conventional large-scale logging without detrimental environmental impacts. At a 12% discount rate, the break-even price for carbon is estimated to be about US$ 0.20/tC. This estimate falls toward the low range of carbon prices for existing carbon offset projects that avoid deforestation.",

In this extensive approach, the Sr and Mg contents are well correlated and both are partly related to agricultural and weathering inputs.

      "abstract": "Drought events may induce mangrove mortality and dieback events worldwide as a result of climate extremes. As mangroves sequester large quantities of carbon, quantifying the losses of these stocks following climate disturbances may guide wetland governance strategies globally. In Southeast Brazil, we determined the total ecosystem carbon stocks (TECS) of pristine mangroves that were up to 1851 Mg of carbon per hectare (Mg C ha−1), which are the highest stocks measured from South American and raising estimates of Brazil's mangrove TECS to 0.52 Pg C. A mangrove mortality event in the same estuary resulted in a 14.6 % decrease in TECS (270.5 Mg C ha−1) and loss of 20 % of mangrove soil carbon within less than 2-years. Carbon dioxide emissions from this impact were 992.8 Mg CO2e ha−1, which are slightly lower than emissions from land use disturbances on mangroves worldwide. Our results suggest that climate effects on mangroves can become significant sources of greenhouse gases globally.",

Impacts from sea level rise, ocean acidification, increases in ocean temperature, potential collapse of the thermohaline circulation; failure of the South Asia monsoon; the melting of sea ice, the Greenland Ice Sheet and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet; changes in water availability; and Amazonia forest dieback, are considered. The review highlights that while a number of uncertainties remain in understanding, there is evidence to suggest that climate change may have already affected some ecosystem services. Furthermore, there is considerable evidence to show that future climate change could have impacts on biodiversity, as well as secondary impacts on issues important to human society, including; habitability; land productivity and food security; water security; and potential economic impacts.",

      "abstract": "In democracies around the world, societies have demonstrated that elections can have major consequences for the environment. In Colombia, the 2022 presidential elections will take place at a time when progress towards peace has stalled and socioeconomic, security, and environmental conditions have deteriorated. The recent declines in these conditions largely coincide with the change of government after the 2018 elections, and the associated rise to power of a party that boycotted the peace negotiations from the beginning. These indicators suggest that 2018 marked the end of a decade of improvements in safety, wealth, and equality—societal factors that can interact with the environment in multiple ways. A spike in assassinations of land and environmental defenders in 2019 and 2020 made Colombia one of the most dangerous places in the world for environmentalists. With the 2022 presidential election, Colombians will once again decide who will govern the country and what new social, economic, and environmental policies will be implemented. In preparation for elections like this, we believe that it is important for scientists with relevant backgrounds to highlight relationships between political events and the environment, to enrich the political debate, help prioritize public resources, and inform policy-making. Here, we provide a multidisciplinary analysis of different socioeconomic and environmental trends that can help inform the public and decision-makers. We intend for this analysis to be useful not only in Colombia, but also to other societies under similar situations, managing biodiversity-rich ecosystems in socio-political environments of increasing violence, poverty, and inequality.",

      "abstract": "This study uses a spatial bio-economic modelling framework to estimate the impact of the 2012 weather extreme in the USA on food security in the developing world. The study also quantifies the potential effects of a similar weather extreme occurring in 2050 under climate change. The study results indicate that weather extremes that affect maize productivity in key grain baskets can negatively affect food security in vulnerable countries. The 2012 weather extreme which occurred in the USA reduced US and global maize production by 29% compared to trend; maize consumption in the country decreased by 5% only and this resulted in less surplus maize for exports from the largest maize exporter in the world. Global maize production decreased by 6% compared to trend. The decrease in global maize production coupled with a reduction in the volume of global maize exports worsened food insecurity in eastern Africa, the Caribbean and Central America and India. The effects of the weather extreme on global food security would be worse, if the latter were to occur under climate change in 2050, assuming no climate change adaptation worldwide over the years. In addition, the hardest-hit regions would remain the same, whether the weather extreme occurs in 2012 instead of 2050: Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), South Asia and the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region. However, sustained growth in per capita income across world economies between 2000 and 2050 would allow few countries in SSA and the LAC region to virtually eliminate hunger within their borders. In these countries, per capita income would be high enough by 2050 to completely offset the negative effect of the weather extreme. The study results are also consistent with USDA׳s estimates on US and global maize production and consumption in 2012 after the weather extreme. Some discrepancy is found on the volume of global maize trade; this implies that the bio-economic model likely overestimates the effect of the weather extreme on food insecurity. However, the trends from the analysis are likely to be valid. Further research would involve using a CGE model that can capture the net effects of weather extremes.",

      "abstract": "This chapter reviews the available paleoecological information on Pantepui since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in order to reconstruct the ecological dynamics that have led to the present configuration of plant communities and to unravel the potential environmental drivers involved, with emphasis on regional climate changes and fire. To date, no LGM sediments have been retrieved atop the tepuis, so the vegetation of these summits during the last glaciation remains unknown. Some lowland records suggest that cold LGM climates favored downward migration of temperature-sensitive tepuian species, which drove changes in the taxonomic composition of lowland forests. The available paleoecological record of Pantepui ranges from the early Holocene to the present. These records show two contrasting situations. Some tepui summits exhibit a long vegetation constancy extending back to the mid-Holocene, whereas others document significant changes in sensitive species that have been associated with regional climatic events, such as the Holocene Thermal Maximum, the latitudinal migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, the El Niño Southern Oscillation variability, or recent climatic shifts such as the Medieval Climatic Anomaly or the Little Ice Age. This has been interpreted in terms of the site’s sensitivity, and it has been recommended to obtain past records, preferably on elevational ecotones, where vertical migrations of species are more easily detected. During the last millennium, fire, most probably of anthropogenic origin and likely originating on the surrounding uplands, has been a major driver of vegetation change on some tepuis.",

      "abstract": "The term “wilderness” has several dimensions. It is used as a biological descriptor for intact or largely intact areas that have little or no industrial infrastructure and are remote from urban areas. It is also used as a protected area classification for areas corresponding to Category 1b—wilderness areas in IUCN's protected areas classification system. And finally, the term “wilderness” captures human relationships with wild places—from Indigenous Peoples who view wilderness not as a thing apart but as “home” to sacred natural sites to areas where urban populations recreate. Crucially, wilderness areas are not places where people are excluded, but rather places where certain human activities are restricted or not allowed. Wilderness areas around the world are shrinking quickly and are increasingly rare, and conservation of Earth's remaining wilderness is urgently needed: they are indispensable for biodiversity conservation, for climate change mitigation and adaptation, for freshwater quality—and many other ecosystem services—and for the protection of cultural integrity and biocultural landscapes as well as livelihoods.",

      "abstract": "Climate change models predict sea level rise and increased intensity of storms and hurricanes in tropical sea turtle nesting areas. These factors could significantly increase beach inundation and erosion, thus affecting water content of sea turtle nesting beaches. Here, we conducted a field and laboratory study of how sand water content is related to embryonic development and hatching success of leatherback turtle nests. Moreover, we have experimentally incubated eggs of this species in beach sand under standardized conditions, but at different realistic levels of sand water content, varying from 1% to 12%. On the beaches, females nested from the intertidal zone to the lower part of the sand vegetation dunes, where nests were exposed to a wide range of sand water contents that ranged from 0.8% to 22%. However, both field and experimental studies revealed a strong negative correlation between sand water content and emergence success (field study: r=−0.73, P<0.0001; experiment: r=−0.84, P<0.0001). In the field, mean emergence success varied from 0% for the wettest nests to 64% for the driest ones. Nests in wet sand suffered higher mortality, primarily in the earlier developmental stages. Eggs incubated in the driest sand lost mass, but there were no significant effects on hatchling mass or run speed compared to eggs that gained water during incubation. However, hatchling straight carapace length (SCL) was greater in eggs from the driest treatment. The results of the present study inform management of change under future climate change sea level rise scenarios, suggesting that leatherback turtle nesting success should be expected to decrease.",

      "abstract": "The efficiency of carbon (C) sequestration and its long-term storage by the mangroves and other shallow coastal habitats (like seagrass, tidal marsh, macroalgae) has been well recognized in mitigating climate change. Sediment is the largest reservoir of this sequestered C, also known as “blue C.” Blue C can be exported from sediment to the coastal water as dissolved or particulate form, or degraded to CO2 and release in the atmosphere, or it can be buried within the sediment for centuries to millennia. Other than discussing sedimentary C exchange processes in mangroves, we also reviewed current global database of blue C and identified South Asian countries as poor inventory despite a significant coverage (6.5%) and presence of world's largest deltaic mangrove, the Sundarbans (~10,000km2). From data synthesis, blue C stock in South Asian mangroves is overall low compared to the neighboring South East (SE) Asian mangroves, that is due to less C% in sediment, low forest productivity, and nutrient limitation in the sediment. Application of stable isotopes, molecular biomarkers have been discussed to delineate sources of organic carbon (OC) in the sediment. Potential algal sources are recognized to contribute to sedimentary OC in southeastern India and Bangladesh mangroves, that could also explain their low C%, contrast to C-rich SE Asian mangroves where OC is largely of terrigenous origin. In the present discussion, C budget for the Indian Sundarbans has been revisited, that still warrants further investigations on biogeochemical sink processes (some aspects like benthic faunal production, fine root production, lithogenous or biogenous carbonate production, night-time benthic respiration). Lastly, we discussed on various aspects of blue C research to be undertaken in these mangrove ecosystems in future to fill the current gaps and challenges to develop better policies and how blue C research would help in conserving South Asian mangroves.",

      "abstract": "The colonization of the epiphytic niche of Neotropical forest canopies played an important role in orchid’s extraordinary diversification, with rare reversions to the terrestrial habit. To understand the evolutionary context of those reversals, we investigated the diversification of Galeandra, a Neotropical orchid genus which includes epiphytic and terrestrial species. We hypothesized that reversion to the terrestrial habit accompanied the expansion of savannas. To test this hypothesis we generated a comprehensive time-calibrated phylogeny and employed comparative methods. We found that Galeandra originated towards the end of the Miocene in Amazonia. The terrestrial clade originated synchronously with the rise of dry vegetation biomes in the last 5 million years, suggesting that aridification dramatically impacted plant diversification and habits in the Neotropics. Shifts in habit impacted floral spur lengths and geographic range size, but not climatic niche. The longer spurs and narrower ranges characterize epiphytic species, which probably adapted to specialized long-tongued Euglossini bee pollinators inhabiting forested habits. The terrestrial species present variable floral spurs and wider distribution ranges, with evidence of self-pollination, suggesting the loss of specialized pollination system and concomitant range expansion. Our study highlights how climate change impacted habit evolution and associated traits such as mutualistic interactions with pollinators.",

Pantepui aquatic insect fauna is composed of genera that are confined to the nutrient-poor waters of the Guiana Shield together with other widespread genera. The unsuitable habitat among tepuis represents an ecological barrier, which limits faunal interchange among tepuis through adjacent lowlands and uplands. Limited dispersal among tepui summits and habitat shifts from summits to adjacent savannas or vice versa, followed by long-term isolation, have played important roles in species diversification. Therefore a single-tepui endemism is a common phenomenon, although the occurrence of the same species on multiple tepuis has also been recorded. A systematic study of Pantepui aquatic insect taxonomy, distribution, and ecology, as well as the structure of aquatic communities and their ecosystems’ functioning, are necessary in order to elucidate the evolutionary and ecological processes that have formed its aquatic communities.",

      "abstract": "Modeling soil water availability for tropical trees is a prerequisite to predicting the future impact of climate change on tropical forests. In this paper we develop a discrete-time deterministic water balance model adapted to tropical rainforest climates, and we validate it on a large dataset that includes micro-meteorological and soil parameters along a topographic gradient in a lowland forest of French Guiana. The model computes daily water fluxes (rainfall interception, drainage, tree transpiration and soil plus understorey evapotranspiration) and soil water content using three input variables: daily precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and solar radiation. A novel statistical approach is employed that uses Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR) soil moisture data to estimate water content at permanent wilting point and at field capacity, and root distribution. Inaccuracy of the TDR probes and other sources of uncertainty are taken into account by model calibration through a Bayesian framework. Model daily output includes relative extractable water, REW, i.e. the daily available water standardized by potential available water. The model succeeds in capturing temporal variations in REW regardless of topographic context. The low Root Mean Square Error of Predictions suggests that the model captures the most important drivers of soil water dynamics, i.e. water refilling and root water extraction. Our model thus provides a useful tool to explore the response of tropical forests to climate scenarios of changing rainfall regime and intensity.",

      "abstract": "There is increasing concern, to what extent production forests in the Neotropics are sustainably managed. The implementation of effective forest management strategies that are ecologically beneficial plays thus a central role to prevent forest degradation. However, to identify effective forest management strategies, there is a need for methods supporting the decision-making process. The main objective of our study is to analyze the mid- and long-term impacts of different management intensities, such as varying the minimum stem diameter of harvestable commercial trees, on the dynamic and structure of a species-rich tropical lowland forest of French Guiana. Therefore, we have applied the management module of a dynamic forest model and analyzed simulation experiments for undisturbed forest growth and selective logging. For the first time we were able to quantify the mean recovery times of multiple ecosystem functions and properties (biomass, gross primary production, leaf area index, Shanon diversity, timber volume) after selective logging. Accordingly, we validated simulation results (biomass, number of trees harvested) of selective logging with forest inventory data from the last 32 years. The forest model reliably reproduces the observed pre-logging biomass, tree-size distribution, and logging intensity (10 trees/ha, 39 m3/ha). In addition, it became clear how strongly management with higher logging intensities influences the forest in the long term: (1) the mean recovery times of the investigated ecosystem functions were significantly extended. With very intensive logging (116 m3/ha), the average recovery time of forest biomass was almost twice as long as in a moderate simulation scenario (tint 138 a, tmod 77 a). Similar patterns were observed for other ecosystem functions, e.g. timber volume (tint 158 a, tmod 62 a). (2) Additionally, the functional composition shifted, as up to 30% pioneer tree species in particular invaded the forest. This innovative use of forest growth models may help in the development of ecologically reasonable forest management strategies.",

Stand structure and species diversity were assessed in 27 sample plots (20 m× 20 m) covering 1.08 ha of forest. A total of 11 species were recorded. Out of them, 7, 6, and 9 species were found in fresh water, moderate, and strong saline zone, respectively. Species dominance in terms of importance value showed Heritiera fomes > Excoecaria agallocha > Bruguiera sexangula > Xylocarpus mekongensis in fresh water zone; H. fomes > E. agallocha > Avicennia officinalis > Ceriops decandra in moderate saline zone. E. agallocha > Sonneratia apetala > H. fomes > C. decandra in strong saline zone. Species diversity decreased from fresh water to strong saline zone. The findings showed a wide range of leaf morphological plasticity of all the parameters within and among saline zones. Leaf index, plasticity index, and specific leaf area were maximum in fresh water zone than of others. The findings of PCA revealed clear evidences of plastic behavior of leaf morphological parameters. Thus, the plasticity of leaf morphology might contribute as an influential biological signs of forthcoming climate change events.",

      "abstract": "This paper undertakes an exploration of the potential application of the Weitzman prioritisation approach to the conservation of plant genetic resources (PGR). Using a case study approach and assuming limited conservation resources, this approach is applied to calculate the maximum diversity which can be conserved based on a clustering of cacao species (Theobroma cacao L.). A conservation budget allocation model applied across a set of ten clusters and nine subclusters of cacao, together with the use of alternative diversity and risk measures, allowed for an evaluation of a range of potential conservation outcomes. Alternative risk measures generally resulted in the allocation of conservation funds to the same priority clusters of cacao (Criollo and Curaray). However, the use of the number of locally common alleles as an alternative to the original Weitzman diversity measure produced a markedly different result, prioritising the Purús cluster in Western Amazonia. The Curaray cluster was highly prioritised under both diversity measures, indicating its distinctiveness relative to both the Criollo and Purús clusters. We conclude that the Weitzman approach can indeed allow diversity comparisons to be made between the outcomes of different PGR conservation strategies, although subjective decisions regarding the choice of diversity and risk measures remain.",

      "abstract": "Scientific information on the shrimp and groundfish resources of the Brazil–Guianas continental shelf has been produced by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism (CRFM), in collaboration with the national governments exploiting the resources, since the early 1970s. In spite of the availability of such information, largely as grey literature, there is limited evidence as to the extent it is being used in fisheries management in Trinidad and Tobago. The flow of information between multiple stakeholders − fishing industry, scientists, fisheries managers, policy makers, and fisheries advisory bodies − was studied based on responses to a survey of key individuals to document each of their roles in the creation, distribution, and use of fisheries information. Content analysis of responses was completed to determine the opportunities and barriers for using scientific information in fisheries management. Salience, credibility, and legitimacy of the information were shadowed by barriers that decreased these attributes. Knowledge about the fishery has increased and technical capabilities have been strengthened through research. At the same time, advances in digital technology have made information more accessible. Yet, the high technical content of fisheries information reduced its usefulness to some stakeholders and formal systems do not exist for distributing or measuring the use and influence of such information in decision making. Communication strategies to promote awareness of the scientific information and aligning scientific information with fisheries policy could increase its use and influence. Institutional support for partnerships and education to encourage stakeholder involvement could also facilitate increased influence of scientific information.",

      "abstract": "The Neotropical Region is highly diverse geographically, climatically, and biologically. Freshwater ecosystems are impacted by many stressors with impacts that remain poorly understood. While we know the status and the effects of some stressors on certain fish and invertebrate species, whole ecosystem effects are yet to be understood. We describe the status and general trends of 10 stressors: variation in rainfall due to climate change; changes in forest cover (e.g., logging, deforestation, and afforestation); agriculture and livestock; impervious cover (e.g., urban areas); mining operations; flow regulation; loss of riparian zones and floodplains; overfishing; and the introduction of exotic species. Agriculture, mining, and increase in impervious cover due to urbanization are the major stressors for neotropical freshwater ecosystems. Although information is limited the local extinctions of freshwater populations and the loss of ecosystem functions and services are common and likely to increase given the limited conservation measures applied in the region.",

      "abstract": "The Demerara Plateau, off the French Guiana and Surinam margin, corresponds to a prominent sub-horizontal marginal plateau. The interpretation of a large set of seismic data acquired along the Demerara Plateau and integration with previous seismic stratigraphy and drill studies enables a better understanding of the sedimentary evolution of the outer Demerara marginal plateau. Since the end of the transform activity (late Albian), three sedimentary evolutionary stages have been identified. 1) The Pre-contourite Stage (late Albian to early Miocene) is strongly controlled by the structure of the margin that influences the distribution pattern of post-transform deposits through differential thermal subsidence between transform and divergent segments. 2) The Transitional Stage (middle Miocene to early Pliocene) is expressed as a current-controlled erosive surface resulting from the onset of bottom-current interactions due to the establishment and strengthening of the modern thermohaline circulation that is coeval with the progressive closure of the Isthmus of Panama. 3) The Contourite Stage (middle Pliocene to Holocene) is characterized by the development of a contourite depositional system that is linked to the activity of the North Atlantic Deep Water circulation and by a complex interaction between alongslope and downslope processes. Our study highlights that marginal plateaus might be particularly prone to develop contourite features since they regionally influence ocean current dynamics in guiding and accelerating bottom contour currents. Marginal plateaus should thus be considered as a key target to study bottom current dynamics and paleocirculation patterns.",

Under current and future global changes, 90% of the coastlines are at risk, facing challenges of rising sea level (SL). Since the last century, scientists have attempted to understand processes governing RSL, to separate variations in absolute SL from those due to vertical land movement, and to discover their links to climate change. Recently developed space technologies provide accurate estimates of ongoing SL changes. Combined with tide gauge records, these new instruments (global positioning system, altimetry, interferometric synthetic aperture radar) offer a new perspective for the science associated with SL and its changes. This chapter reviews the concept of RSL, of RSL hotspots, and describes different RSL measurements. Then, it identifies and maps the hotspots of RSL changes and updates, where possible, previously published estimates of RSL trends. Identification of the RSL hotspots is of paramount importance for climate change mitigation and adaptation in tropical regions.",

      "abstract": "The inclusion of managed tropical forests in climate change mitigation has made it important to find the sustainable sweet-spot for timber production, carbon retention, and the quick recovery of both. Here we focus on recovery of aboveground carbon and timber stocks over the first 32years after selective logging with the CELOS Harvest System in Suriname. Our data are from twelve 1-ha permanent sample plots in which growth, survival, and recruitment of trees ≥15cm diameter were monitored between 1978 and 2012. We evaluate plot-level changes in basal area, stem density, aboveground carbon, and timber stock in response to average timber harvests of 15, 23, and 46m3ha−1. We use a linear mixed-effects model in a Bayesian framework to quantify recovery time for aboveground carbon and timber stock, as well as annualized increments for both. Our statistical models accounted for the uncertainty associated with the height and biomass allometries used to estimate aboveground carbon and increased precision of annualized aboveground carbon increments by including data from forty-one plots located elsewhere on the Guiana Shield. The probabilities of aboveground carbon recovery to pre-logging levels 32years after harvests of 15, 23 and 46m3ha−1 were 45%, 40%, and 24%, respectively. Net aboveground carbon increment for logged forests across all harvest intensities was 0.64MgCha−1yr−1, more than twice the rate observed in unlogged forests (0.26MgCha−1yr−1). The probabilities of timber stock recovery at the end of the 32-year period were highest after harvest intensities of 15 and 23m3ha−1 (with 80% probability) and lowest after the harvest of 46m3ha−1 (with 70% probability). Timber stock recovery across all harvest intensities was driven primarily by residual tree growth. Application of the legal cutting limit of 25m3ha−1 will require more than 70 and 40years to recover aboveground carbon and timber stocks, respectively, with 90% probability. Based on the low recruitment rates of the twelve species harvested, the 25year cutting cycle currently implemented in Suriname is too short for long-term timber stock sustainability. We highlight the value of propagating uncertainty from individual tree measurements to statistical predictions of carbon stock recovery. Ultimately, our study reveals the trade-offs that must be made between timber and carbon services as well as the opportunity to use carbon payments to enable longer cutting rotations to capture carbon from forest regrowth.",

We use predictors extracted from the Canopy Height Model to compare models of varying complexity: single or multiple regressions and nested models that predict BA by independent estimates of stem density and quadratic mean diameter. Direct multiple regression was the most accurate, giving a 9.6% Root Mean Squared Error of Prediction (RMSEP). The magnitude of the various errors introduced during the data collection stage is evaluated and their contribution to MSEP is analyzed. It was found that these errors accounted for less than 10% of model MSEP, suggesting that there is considerable scope for model improvement. Although site-specific models showed lower MSEP than global models, stratification by site may not be the optimal solution. The key to future improvement would appear to lie in a stratification that captures variations in relations between LiDAR and forest structure.",

      "abstract": "Conservation-related concerns about Pantepui usually pertain to direct human impacts (biopiracy, invader species, fire, contamination, etc.), and little attention has been paid to indirect threats, such as global warming (GW). This chapter summarizes the studies carried out to date aimed at estimating the potential impact of the projected GW by the end of this century on the Pantepui biota, particularly on vascular plants. The main threat seems to be extinction caused by habitat loss due to the impossibility of upward migration on the flat summits of the tepuis. Potential extinction has been estimated on the basis of GW predictions from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) using the altitudinal range shift (ARS) and species–area relationship (SAR) methods. The preliminary results suggest the potential extinction of up to approximately 80% of the vascular flora, including approximately 50% of the Pantepui–endemic species. Several in situ and ex situ protection measures are discussed in an attempt to palliate such eventual biodiversity depletion. The available extinction estimates are preliminary and based on homogeneous responses of all vascular plants to GW, which is not fully realistic but is all that can be done with the available information. Future studies should be aimed at refining extinction estimates, considering the eventual idiosyncratic responses of the different species, such as differential migration rates, phenotypic plasticity, or adaptive ability. However, the main handicap is the lack of autoecological information on Pantepui species and the unfeasibility of conducting such studies due to the bureaucratic impediments related to obtaining sampling permits. It is urgent to circumvent this situation if the biodiversity of Pantepui, one of the very few pristine locations left on our planet, is to be preserved.",

      "abstract": "During the past few decades, commercial silvopastoral systems (SPS) with exotic Eucalyptus (hybrid) trees have become popular in the Brazilian Cerrado (savanna). With the increasing awareness about the role of carbon (C) storage in soils as a climate-change mitigation strategy and the relationship between the nature of soil aggregates and the soil's carbon sequestration potential, it is important to understand the influence of such SPS systems on soil organic carbon (SOC) storage. We studied C content in three aggregate size classes in six land-use systems on Oxisols in Minas Gerais, Brazil. The systems were planted forest, native secondary forest, managed pasture, and three 8-year-old SPS, differing in their tree-planting configurations. Eucalyptus hybrid was the tree in SPS and planted forest treatments, and Urochloa decumbens was the grass in SPS and pasture treatments. From each treatment, replicated soil samples were collected from four depth-classes (0–10, 10–30, 30–60, and 60–100 cm), fractionated by wet sieving into the three aggregate-size classes, 2000 to 250 μm, 250 to 53 μm, and <53 μm size classes representing macroaggregates, microaggregates, and silt + clay, respectively, and their C contents determined. Down to 1 m, total SOC stock values ranged from 260 Mg ha−1 under pasture to 167 Mg ha−1 under native forest, with 174 Mg ha−1 for Eucalyptus plantation and about 195 Mg ha−1 for the three SPS. Compared to the degraded native forest, the pasture system had significantly higher SOC in the whole soil and the aggregate size fractions, especially in the lower soil-depth classes. The lower SOC stock of Eucalyptus hybrid SPS compared to open pasture differs from the general trend of SPS having higher stock. Given that the Cerrado biome is a biodiversity hotspot, the use of native nitrogen-fixing trees, of which there are several, is worth investigating. In addition, the conversion from Eucalyptus monocultures to SPS could be considered as a strategy to increase the SOC stock.",

Forest vulnerability to external factors (e.g. air pollution, acid rain) is widely studied in northern countries, while only a few attempts have investigated crown integrity in the Tropics. The method needs to be generic enough to account for the large number of species and crown shapes encountered in tropical forests. In the present study, we developed and tested a novel field method that estimates crown fragmentation (main branch mortality (MB) and secondary branch mortality (SB)), liana infestation (LI) and crown position (CP) in the canopy. The relationship between crown fragmentation and annual growth rate (agr) was investigated through multiple regression. Six out of eight canopy tree species showed significant growth decline with increasing crown fragmentation. Higher probability of death was also found in trees with severe crown fragmentation. The capacity of such crown assessment to depict tree vitality in a forest stand is discussed along with potential applications in both forest science and management.",

      "abstract": "The Paris Agreement has set a goal to limit the global average temperature rise to within 2°C from the pre-industrial level. This study aims to explore the possible pathways to achieve this challenging goal by using the Global Energy and Environmental Policy Analysis module (GEEPA) of the China's Climate Change Integrated Assessment Model (C3IAM). Results show that a target temperature of 2°C dramatically reduces global CO2 emissions in the future. Under model parameters, by the end of this century, total global CO2 emissions will fall below 5 Gt, and cumulated CO2 emissions will be reduced to less than 1000 Gt. The key to meeting the 2°C target lies in the low-carbon transformation of energy and electricity systems. Implementation of climate policies and technical measures will progressively reduce conventional fossil energy consumption and replace it with low-carbon energy solutions. The electricity structure will gradually shift from dominance by conventional fossil energy to low-carbon energy, and even to zero-carbon electricity generation. We found that emission reduction pathways that include large amounts of fossil fuel power generation with CCS merely relying on subsidies may create higher GDP loss, but also that later penetration of negative emission technology can increase the carbon emission budget in the early stage.",

      "abstract": "Presence of a coastal savanna belt expanding from British Guiana to northeastern Brazil cannot be explained by present-day climate. Using pollen and charcoal analyses on an 11.6 k old sediment core from a coastal depression in the savanna belt near the mouth of the Amazon River we investigated the paleoenvironmental history to shed light on this question. Results indicate that small areas of savanna accompanied by a forest type composed primarily by the genus Micropholis (Sapotaceae) that has no modern analog existed at the beginning of the Holocene. After 11,200 cal yr BP, savanna accompanied by few trees replaced the forest. In depressions swamp forest developed and by ca 10,000 cal yr BP replaced by Mauritia swamps. Between 8500 and 5600 cal yr BP gallery forest (composed mainly of Euphorbiaceae) and swamp forest succeeded the treeless savanna. The modern vegetation with alternating gallery forest and savanna developed after 5600 cal yr BP. We suggest that the early Holocene no-analog forest is a relict of previously more extensive forest under cooler and moister Lateglacial conditions. The early Holocene savanna expansion indicates a drier phase probably related to the shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) towards its northernmost position. The mid-Holocene forest expansion is probably a result of the combined influence of equatorwards shift of ITCZ joining the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ). The ecosystem variability during the last 5600 cal yr BP, formed perhaps under influence of intensified ENSO condition. High charcoal concentrations, especially during the early Holocene, indicate that natural and/or anthropogenic fires may have maintained the savanna. However, our results propose that climate change is the main driving factor for the formation of the coastal savanna in this region. Our results also show that the early Holocene sea level rise established mangroves near the study site until 7500 cal yr BP and promoted swamp formation in depressions, but did not influence the savanna vegetation.",

      "abstract": "Mangrove forests grow in coastal saline environments and, little is known about the stand water use (S) and regulation mechanisms of mangrove forests, particularly in the eastern mangrove group. We measured the xylem sap flow density (SFD) of six tree species for two years in a tropical mangrove forest on Hainan Island, China, which is under a monsoon climate. Bimodal daily SFD patterns were observed in all six species in spring and summer. The sap flow of all species were suppressed in winter strongly and also in spring. The annual water use per tree was positively correlated with diameter at breast height (DBH) (R2 = 0.81–0.89, P < 0.05). By scaling up from individual trees, we found that the S values of two mangrove plots ranged from 269.19 to 357.27 mm y−1 between the two study years, accounting for 18–22% of the annual rainfall. These S values are similar to those of other mangrove and tropical forests with similar stand basal areas. The crown conductance sensitivity (mc) to ln VPD (vapor pressure deficit) was strongly correlated with reference crown conductance (GCref) at 1 kPa VPD across all species. The slope value between mc and GCref divided the six species into two groups, suggesting Bruguiera sexangula, Rhizophora apiculata and Sonneratia alba were isohydric, Excoecaria agallocha, B. s. var. rhymchopetala and Xylocarpus granatum were anisohydric.

      "abstract": "Earth system models (ESMs) have been widely used to simulate global terrestrial carbon fluxes, including gross primary production (GPP) and net primary production (NPP). Assessment of such GPP and NPP products can be valuable for understanding the efficacy of certain ESMs in simulating the global carbon cycle and future climate impacts. In this work, we studied the model performance of 22 ESMs participating in the fifth and sixth phases of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5 and CMIP6) by comparing historical GPP and NPP simulations with satellite data from MODIS and further evaluating potential model improvement from CMIP5 to CMIP6. In CMIP6, the average global total GPP and NPP estimated by the 22 ESMs are 16% and 13% higher than MODIS data, respectively. The multi-model ensembles (MME) of the 22 ESMs can fairly reproduce the spatial distribution, zonal distribution and seasonal variations of both GPP and NPP from MODIS. They perform much better in simulating GPP and NPP for grasslands, wetlands, croplands and other biomes than forests. However, there are noticeable differences among individual ESM simulations in terms of overall fluxes, temporal and spatial flux distributions, and fluxes by biome and region. The MME consistently outperforms all individual models in nearly every respect. Even though several ESMs have been improved in CMIP6 relative to CMIP5, there is still much work to be done to improve individual ESM and overall CMIP performance. Future work needs to focus on more comprehensive model mechanisms and parametrizations, higher resolution and more reasonable coupling of land surface schemes and atmospheric/oceanic schemes.",

      "abstract": "Plant oil is a key commodity in the global economy, particularly for food and bioenergy markets. However, current production practices often impair smallholder livelihoods, cause land use changes, and compete for food production. The neotropical palm Acrocomia aculeata is currently being promoted as a novel sustainable biomass feedstock, particularly for bioenergy, but only little is known about the palm’s ecological requirements. Based on a comprehensive literature and database search for recorded occurrences of A. aculeata in Latin America, we computed an ecological niche modeling to determine the palm’s potential distribution area based on climatic and soil variables. We subsequently considered current land cover and predicted future climate change scenarios to discuss the cultivation potential of A. aculeata within its possible distribution area. The results revealed a large potential to cultivate A. aculeata in Latin America under current abiotic environmental conditions. The two core distribution regions identified were (1) Central America including the Caribbean, northern Colombia and Venezuela, and (2) southern Brazil and eastern Paraguay. A considerable proportion of the medium to highly suitable growing areas were found to be currently used for agricultural production or covered by land types with high conservation and carbon sequestration value. Applying the model under the IPCC’s A2A ‘business as usual’ emission scenario suggested that by 2080 the vast majority of suitable growing areas severely decline in extent or disappear entirely. Our ecological niche modeling thus shows that despite the palm’s high cultivation potential, a sustainable deployment of A. aculeata requires a precautious, evidence-based approach.",

      "abstract": "Global temperatures have increased at a historically unprecedented pace. This paper finds that the negative effect of temperature on output in countries with hot climates runs through reduced investment, depressed labor productivity, poorer human health, and lower agricultural and industrial output. We find that hot low-income countries suffer the largest costs. In a median low-income country, aggregate output is about 2 percent lower and investment is about 10 percent lower seven years after a 1 degree increase in average annual temperature. We also find that economic development, in general, helps to shield countries from temperature shocks, with hot regions in high-income countries on average sustaining less economic damage from rising temperatures than hot regions in low-income countries.",

      "abstract": "Globally, mangroves sequester a large amount of carbon into the sediments, although spatial heterogeneity exists owing to a wide variety of local, regional, and global controls. Rapid environmental and climate change, including increasing sea-level rise, global warming, reduced upstream discharge and anthropogenic activities, are predicted to increase salinity in the mangroves, especially in the Bangladesh Sundarbans, thereby disrupting this blue carbon reservoir. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how salinity affects the belowground soil carbon despite the recognised effect on above ground productivity. To address this gap, research was undertaken in the Bangladesh Sundarbans to compare total soil organic carbon (SOC) across three salinity zones and to explore any potential predictive relationships with other physical, chemical properties and vegetation characteristics. Total SOC was significantly higher in the oligohaline zone (74.8 ± 14.9 Mg ha−1), followed by the mesohaline (59.3 ± 15.8 Mg ha−1), and polyhaline zone (48.3 ± 10.3 Mg ha−1) (ANOVA, F2, 500 = 118.9, p < 0.001). At all sites, the topmost 10 cm of soil contained higher SOC density than the bottom depths (ANOVA, F3, 500 = 30.1, p < 0.001). On average, Bruguiera sp. stand holds the maximum SOC measured, followed by two pioneer species Sonneratia apetala and Avicennia sp. Multiple regression results indicated that soil salinity, organic C:N and tree diameter were the best predictor for the variability of the SOC in the Sundarbans (R2 = 0.62). Despite lower carbon in the soil, the study highlights that the conservation priorities and low deforestation rate have led to less CO2 emissions than most sediment carbon-rich mangroves in the world. The study also emphasised the importance of spatial conservation planning to safeguard the soil carbon-rich zones in the Bangladesh Sundarbans from anthropogenic tourism and development activities to support climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies.",

      "abstract": "The western tropical Atlantic plays an important role in the interhemispheric redistribution of heat during millennial-scale changes in the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The proper evaluation of this role depends on a clear understanding of sea surface temperature (SST) variations during AMOC slowdown periods like Heinrich Stadials (HS) in the western tropical Atlantic. However, published SST records from the western tropical Atlantic between ca. 4°S and 7°N show inconsistencies that are apparently related to the employed temperature proxy (i.e., Mg/Ca versus alkenone unsaturation index U37k′). In general, while Mg/Ca values indicate warming during Heinrich Stadials, U37k′ values show cooling. To assess this issue, we sampled core GeoB16224-1 retrieved off French Guiana (i.e., 6°39.38′N) and reconstructed water temperatures at high resolution using Mg/Ca on the foraminifera species Globigerinoides ruber, U37k′, TEX86 and modern analogue technique (MAT) transfer functions using planktonic foraminifera assemblages calibrated for 50 m water depth. Our results show that Mg/Ca and TEX86 values recorded an increase in SST related to AMOC slowdown. Conversely, U37k′ and MAT values registered a decrease in temperatures during HS3 and HS1. Our U37k′ and Mg/Ca results thus confirm the previously reported inconsistency for the period between 48–13 cal ka BP. We suggest that several non-thermal physiological effects probably imparted a negative temperature bias on the U37k′ temperatures during Heinrich Stadials. However, MAT-based temperatures show similar variability with U37k′-based temperatures. Hence, we also suggest that during severe slowdown periods of the AMOC, a steeper meridional temperature gradient together with a southward shift of the Intertropical Convergent Zone produced not only an increase in SST but also a stronger upper water column stratification and a shoaling of the thermocline, decreasing subsurface temperatures. Our new high resolution temperature records allow a better characterization of the thermal response of the upper water column in the tropical western Atlantic to slowdown events of the AMOC, reconciling previously discrepant records.",

      "abstract": "The North Brazil Shelf is a Large Marine Ecosystem (LME) that extends from the Caribbean Sea, in Central America, to the Parnaiba River in Brazil, and includes six countries. The area is dominated by the runoff of large rivers, including the Amazon and Orinoco, and by the intense disturbance of sediment transport, tides and currents. The sea bed is formed mainly by mud in shallow water, and by sand, mud, and gravel in deeper water. In terms of its biological productivity, this LME can be considered oligotrophic, with stratified habitats. The main source of nutrients of the euphotic layer is the local rivers and mangroves. Primary production has been limited by light and rising temperatures in recent years, factors associated with a decrease in marine primary productivity. However, the benthic fauna is very rich and unique, but poorly known. More than 500 fish species have been recorded in this LME. Demersal fish and shrimp are the main fishery resources in coastal and continental shelf waters. Fisheries account for more than 600 million USD a year with a considerable diversity of methods and scales ranging from very small to industrial. Seafood consumption is moderate to high in the local countries. Climate changes, dam building, deforestation, pollution, overfishing, tourism and aquaculture are the main threats to ecosystem productivity and habitat quality. Socioeconomic data are scant for this LME. Development is concentrated near the cities and mouths of rivers. Traditional communities in the coastal areas are culturally diverse, but invariably characterized by very low socioeconomic conditions. The Gross Domestic Product of the local countries ranges from 7,500 USD per capita in Guyana to 32,600 USD per capita in Trinidad and Tobago. Profound problems of governability are common to all six countries, and mean governance indicators reflect poor performances in all cases. The main issues are an absence of effective rule of law, political stability, and control of corruption. Fisheries are characterized by increasing effort and an absence of sustainability. Most of the fishery stocks are either fully or over exploited. This scenario can only be rectified by investments in marine protected areas and scientific research, as well as the increased participation of fishers in the development and implementation of management strategies and regulations.",

      "abstract": "Global timber demands have penetrated vast tracts of tropical rainforest, with selective logging the most powerful driver of human disturbance within these ecosystems. We review the consequences of timber harvesting on rainforest ecosystems, from individual species through to biological communities. We also investigate the benefits that forest-dwelling communities and wider society can derive from well-managed production forests. Selectively logged forests maintain a wide array of ecosystem services, and orders of magnitude higher levels of biodiversity and carbon storage than the agricultural lands that often imperil them. To unlock the full potential of logged forests in conserving biodiversity, tackling climate change and delivering ecosystem services into the Anthropocene will require several major transitions. These include a pantropical shift towards more environmentally sensitive logging practises, the fostering of new norms in tropical forestry based around long-term forest management, as well as coordinated efforts to limit the negative effects of logging roads, illegal logging and climate change. We discuss potential incentive and enforcement-based mechanisms for precipitating such transitions and highlight key avenues for future enquiry. Research frontiers include determining how best to spatially design logging operations to limit environmental impacts, quantifying the costs and benefits of post-logging activities aimed at recovering logged forest values, and investigating the role of concession licence structures in spawning sustainable forest management. Given their spatial dominance and high conservation value, lofty planetary goals to limit climate change and global biodiversity declines cannot be achieved unless selectively logged tropical forests take a central role in emerging conservation and emissions-reducing agendas.",

      "abstract": "Assessing the role of tropical forests in biogeochemical cycles is one of the greatest scientific challenges of the century. The impact of climate change could increase the mortality of tropical forests and decrease their ability to store atmospheric carbon dioxide. Efforts to model the forest dynamics in these regions are hindered by the lack of ground measurements and the spatial-temporal overlap of function management processes. Some of the models developed attempt to show the environment’s influence on forest dynamics, particularly by studying the capacity for canopy deformation (plasticity of the crown), as explained in Purves et al. The models allow us to better understand the development of intertree competition, the capacity of species to adapt to changes and how the forest functions as a whole.",

      "abstract": "The interest in quantifying rare species has been increasing, but less attention has been paid to analysing their conservation status. Here, we used the Rabinowitz method based on geographical range, habitat specificity and population size to classify 2,203 tree species of South American savannas (SAS). We considered species with narrow (stenochoric) or wide (eurychoric) geographic range respectively occurring in up to 10% or over of the latitudinal belts in the SAS, specialist (stenoecious) or generalist (euryoecious) species occurring in one or more ecoregions, respectively, and locally scarce or abundant populations of species with low or high numbers of records within a grid cell of 1° latitude by 1° longitude, respectively. We then quantified species which only occur inside protected areas (PAs), in and outside PAs, or only outside PAs. Of the 2,203 species, 49.25% were rare, 40.35% stenochoric, 14.12% stenoecious and 56.15% had a scarce population. The Cerrado (433) followed by Caatinga (259), Campos Rupestres montane savanna (256), Bahia interior forests (189) and Guiana savanna (154) had the highest number of rare species. Only 6.44% species only occurred inside PAs, 83.79% in and outside PAs and 9.75% only outside PAs. Unprotected species are mostly geographically restricted with ecoregion specialists, and have small population sizes. The number of protected species are is positively correlated with the number of records within them. The establishment of PAs should focus on both core and disjunct savannas to encompass all ecoregions in order to ensure the conservation of species and the range of evolutionary processes in SAS.",

      "abstract": "Changes in the life cycle of organisms (i.e. phenology) are one of the most widely used early-warning indicators of climate change, yet this remains poorly understood throughout the tropics. We exhaustively reviewed any published and unpublished study on fruiting phenology carried out at the community level in the American tropics and subtropics (latitudinal range: 26°N–26°S) to (1) provide a comprehensive overview of the current status of fruiting phenology research throughout the Neotropics; (2) unravel the climatic factors that have been widely reported as drivers of fruiting phenology; and (3) provide a preliminary assessment of the potential phenological responses of plants under future climatic scenarios. Despite the large number of phenological datasets uncovered (218), our review shows that their geographic distribution is very uneven and insufficient for the large surface of the Neotropics (~1 dataset per ~78,000km2). Phenological research is concentrated in few areas with many studies (state of São Paulo, Brazil, and Costa Rica), whereas vast regions elsewhere are entirely unstudied. Sampling effort in fruiting phenology studies was generally low: the majority of datasets targeted fewer than 100 plant species (71%), lasted 2years or less (72%), and only 10.4% monitored >15 individuals per species. We uncovered only 10 sites with ten or more years of phenological monitoring. The ratio of numbers of species sampled to overall estimates of plant species richness was wholly insufficient for highly diverse vegetation types such as tropical rainforest, seasonal forest and cerrado, and only slightly more robust for less diverse vegetation types, such as deserts, arid shrublands and open grassy savannas. Most plausible drivers of phenology extracted from these datasets were environmental (78.5%), whereas biotic drivers were rare (6%). Among climatic factors, rainfall was explicitly included in 73.4% of cases, followed by air temperature (19.3%). Other environmental cues such as water level (6%), solar radiation or photoperiod (3.2%), and ENSO events (1.4%) were rarely addressed. In addition, drivers were analyzed statistically in only 38% of datasets and techniques were basically correlative, with only 4.8% of studies including any consideration of the inherently autocorrelated character of phenological time series. Fruiting peaks were significantly more often reported during the rainy season both in rainforests and cerrado woodlands, which is at odds with the relatively aseasonal character of the former vegetation type. Given that climatic models predict harsh future conditions for the tropics, we urgently need to determine the magnitude of changes in plant reproductive phenology and distinguish those from cyclical oscillations. Long-term monitoring and herbarium data are therefore key for detecting these trends. Our review shows that the unevenness in geographic distribution of studies, and diversity of sampling methods, vegetation types, and research motivation hinder the emergence of clear general phenological patterns and drivers for the Neotropics. We therefore call for prioritizing research in unexplored areas, and improving the quantitative component and statistical design of reproductive phenology studies to enhance our predictions of climate change impacts on tropical plants and animals.",

Degraded ecosystems can affect water quality and availability, and cause a decrease in food production, climatic instability, poor protection against natural hazards (e.g., floods and storms), and loss of natural landscapes for aesthetic enjoyment. However, the most conspicuous and well-understood risks to health are those related to the infectious and parasitic diseases, especially those endemic in the tropical regions. The main driving forces responsible for ecosystem change today are the economic activities implemented to provide basic materials for livelihoods, such as a agriculture and animal husbandry, materials for construction (e.g., logging), and the provision of energy and water (e.g., dam building). Impacts of climate change also pose a new threat to ecosystems. These changes are taking place in a more rapid and intensive form in developing countries in the tropics.",

      "abstract": "Temperature increases can impact biodiversity and predicting their effects is one of the main challenges facing global climate-change research. Ectotherms are sensitive to temperature change and, although predictions indicate that tropical species are highly vulnerable to global warming, they remain one of the least studied groups with respect to the extent of physiological variation and local extinction risks. We model the extinction risks for a tropical heliothermic teiid lizard (Kentropyx calcarata) integrating previously obtained information on intraspecific phylogeographic structure, eco-physiological traits and contemporary species distributions in the Amazon rainforest and its ecotone to the Cerrado savannah. We also investigated how thermal-biology traits vary throughout the species' geographic range and the consequences of such variation for lineage vulnerability. We show substantial variation in thermal tolerance of individuals among thermally distinct sites. Thermal critical limits were highly correlated with operative environmental temperatures. Our physiological/climatic model predicted relative extinction risks for local populations within clades of K. calcarata for 2050 ranging between 26.1% and 70.8%, while for 2070, extinction risks ranged from 52.8% to 92.8%. Our results support the hypothesis that tropical-lizard taxa are at high risk of local extinction caused by increasing temperatures. However, the thermo-physiological differences found across the species' distribution suggest that local adaptation may allow persistence of this tropical ectotherm in global warming scenarios. These results will serve as basis to further research to investigate the strength of local adaptation to climate change. Persistence of Kentropyx calcarata also depends on forest preservation, but the Amazon rainforest is currently under high deforestation rates. We argue that higher conservation priority is necessary so the Amazon rainforest can fulfill its capacity to absorb the impacts of temperature increase on tropical ectotherms during climate change.",

Two simulation experiments are performed and indicate the success of the suggested method.

      "abstract": "Fire is used in the management of pastures, renewal and expansion of areas, and agricultural activities in South America (SA). The objectives of this study were: i) to identify the countries and regions with the highest number of fire foci in SA, and ii) to evaluate the spatial dynamics of fire foci based on the Meteorological Fire Danger Index (MFDI) and future scenarios through numerical simulations. Fire foci time series comprised 21 years (1998–2018) from the BDQueimadas database. Cluster Analysis (CA), descriptive and exploratory statistics were employed. Fire foci maps for SA were made in 10-km pixel dimensions. MFDI was used to assess fire danger via SPEEDY (Simplified Parametrizations, primitivE-Equation DYnamics) model simulations. Three simulations were performed: control scenario (1980–2015), RCP2.6 scenario (optimistic - 2016 and 2050), and RCP8.5 scenario (pessimistic - 2015 and 2050). Regionally, three homogeneous groups of fire foci (G1, G2 and G3) and one atypical (NA - Not Grouped) were identified for Brazil via CA. The highest fire foci occurred in Brazil (62.72%), followed by Bolivia (9.03%), Argentina (8.28%), Venezuela (6.11%), Paraguay (5.94%), and Colombia (3.87%), respectively. The highest density of fire foci occurred in the MATOPIBA region, the confluence of Maranhão, Tocantins, Piauí, and Bahia, - (agricultural frontier), and also in the Cerrado-Amazon transition and the states of Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul in Brazil, followed by Paraguay, Bolivia, Venezuela, and Argentina. The countries and regions of Brazil do not change, only intensify from year to year, and such fire foci variability may be associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases. The control scenario identified in east-central Brazil, western Bolivia, Paraguay, and northern Argentina. The optimistic scenario showed an improvement in some countries and a worsening in the territorial distribution in Brazil, Venezuela, and Colombia. The pessimistic scenario identified increased degradation compared to the previous scenarios in almost all SA countries.",

      "abstract": "The rainforests of the Neotropics shelter a vast diversity of plant, animal and microscopic species that provide critical ecosystem goods and services for both local and worldwide populations. These environments face a major crisis due to increased deforestation, pollution, and climate change, emphasizing the need for more effective conservation efforts. The adequate monitoring of these ecosystems has proven a complex and time consuming endeavour, which depends on ever dwindling taxonomic expertise. To date, many species remain undiscovered, let alone described, with otherwise limited information regarding known species population distributions and densities. Overcoming these knowledge shortfalls and practical limitations is becoming increasingly possible through techniques based on environmental DNA (eDNA), i.e., DNA that can be obtained from environmental samples (e.g. tissues, soil, sediment, water, etc.). When coupled with high-throughput sequencing, these techniques now enable realistic, cost-effective, and standardisable biodiversity assessments. This opens up enormous opportunities for advancing our understanding of complex and species-rich tropical communities, but also in facilitating large-scale biomonitoring programs in the neotropics. In this review, we provide a brief introduction to eDNA methods, and an overview of their current and potential uses in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems of neotropical rainforests. We also discuss the limits and challenges of these methods for our understanding and monitoring of biodiversity, as well as future research and applied perspectives of these techniques in neotropical rainforests, and beyond.",

      "abstract": "Tropical forests harbor the greatest terrestrial biodiversity and provide various ecosystem services. The increase of human activities on these forests, among which logging, makes the conservation of biodiversity and associated services strongly dependent on the sustainability of these activities. However the indicators commonly used to assess the impact of forest exploitation, namely species richness and biomass, provide a limited understanding of their sustainability. Here, we assessed the sustainability of common forest exploitation in the Guiana Shield studying the recovery of two ecosystem services i.e. carbon storage and wood stock, and an ecosystem function i.e. seed dispersal by animals. Specifically, we compared total and commercial biomass, as well as functional composition in seed size of animal-dispersed species in replicated forest plots before and 27 years after exploitation. Species richness is also studied to allow comparison. While species richness was not affected by forest exploitation, total and commercial biomass as well as seed size of animal-dispersed species decreased 27 years after exploitation, similarly to forests affected by hunting. These results show that ecosystem services and function likely did not recover even at the lowest intensity of forest exploitation studied, questioning the sustainability of the most common rotation-cycle duration applied in the tropics.",

      "abstract": "Coastal wetlands have been proposed as highly threatened by the ongoing and future climatic change, including projected sea-level changes as an additional forcing factor compared to more inland locations. The limited knowledge generated to date in this topic has been primarily focused on those areas attaining a high population density, and rarely deals with long-term (>50 years) dynamics. Here we present the first Holocene palaeoecological study carried in the Orinoco Delta, in NE Venezuela. The record presented here contains sediments from the last 6200 years and is located in a river-shore swamp dominated by the palm Mauritia flexuosa. Current human occupation is almost restricted to small settlements of the Warao indigenous culture, closely related to the use of M. flexuosa and other palm species present in the zone. The results show the occurrence of three well-distinguished palynological zones: (i) from 6200 to 5200 cal yr BP, characterised by mixed rainforest and other taxa related to salinity (coastal-like), low (negative) values of magnetic susceptibility and magnetic grain size, absence of transported clays, and the highest macrocharcoal particles abundance; (ii) from 5200 to 2950 cal yr BP, marked by a replacement of the mangrove-like vegetation by a more inland mixed-swamp forest community with low levels of charcoal, and (iii) from 2950 cal yr BP to present-day, characterised by the establishment of the current vegetation community, dominated by M. flexuosa, and an increasing trend in the charcoal curve since the last 700 years. A combination of regional (climatic changes) and local (sediment ontogeny) has been proposed as the key drivers influencing the vegetation succession recorded. The stabilisation of the sea-level that occurred during the mid-Holocene would have favoured the transgression of the coastal line, with the migration of the coastal-like vegetation seawards. Synchronous to this event, a trend towards drier conditions has been reported in the close Cariaco record, that could have also influenced the vegetation replacement. Between 3800 and 2800 years ago, the increased ENSO variability registered in Cariaco may have played a key role in the expansion of the Mauritia palm community. It is suggested that in our location, the potential inhabiting human populations were differently influenced by these environmental changes. First, the disappearance of the coastal resources could have favoured land abandonment, whereas the increase in the abundance of the palm might be influential for the arrival of other inland cultures that were previously used to manage Mauritia. This sequence shows the importance of the ecosystem services for the location inhabitants, highlighting the abandonment of the mid-Holocene culture coeval with the disappearance of its ecosystem. These results also provide information about the sensitivity and resilience in facing external stressors of both humans and vegetation, and will be valuable tools for managing the future of this ecosystem.",

      "abstract": "Deforestation and agrosystem establishment can alter soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks, leading to greenhouse gases emissions and fertility losses, however SOC response has great variability. In the humid tropics like the Amazonia biome, carbon inputs from agrosystems are rarely quantified and described, despite their major contribution to the SOC dynamics after deforestation. We assessed SOC dynamics with repeated measurements in the layer 0–30cm until five years after deforestation in a diachronic site in French Guiana, cleared with a fire-free method associated to large woody debris inputs. Three agrosystems were studied: one year maize/soybean rotation with disk tillage (DT) and without tillage (NT), and a mowed grassland (G). Aboveground carbon inputs from agrosystems were measured. In addition to SOC stocks assessment, we measured roots carbon stocks, and performed δ13C measurements in grassland soil. We found a transient SOC stock increase until 1.5 years after deforestation because of large woody debris inputs from deforestation method, but these C inputs were rapidly mineralized and poorly contributed to SOC stocks 5 years after deforestation. SOC stocks in grassland did not differ from forest despite large hay exports. Thanks to large root-derived carbon inputs, C4-SOC stock in grassland was 10.4tha−1 5 years after deforestation (18.7% of the SOC stock). In annual crops, 5 years after deforestation, SOC stocks decreased on average by 18.6% compared to forest. SOC stocks did not differ according to soil tillage since aboveground carbon inputs were similar in DT and NT systems. Lower SOC stocks in annual crops compared to grassland is explained by lower carbon restitutions and by higher mineralization rate of organic matter.",

These modifications to the, environment have been altering the dynamics of infectious diseases which have natural foci in the, Amazonian biome, especially in its forest. Current land use practices which are changing the, epidemiological profile of the parasitic diseases in the region are road building; logging; mining; expansion of agriculture and cattle ranching and the building of large dams. Malaria and the cutaneous, leishmaniasis are the diseases best known for their rapid changes in response to environmental, modifications. Others such as soil-transmitted helminthiases, filarial infections and toxoplasmosis, which have part of their developmental cycles in the biophysical environment, are also expected to, change rapidly. An interdisciplinary approach and an integrated, international surveillance are needed, to manage the environmentally-driven changes in the Amazonian parasitic diseases in the near future.",

      "abstract": "In view of the unique biological characteristics of mangroves, it is interesting to assess the extent to which these ecosystems can be used as indicators of coastal change or sea-level rise. From recent studies of mangrove mortality at several locations (including Guiana, Gambia, Côte d'Ivoire, Kenya, India and Bangladesh), it appears that these coastal ecosystems are so specialized that any minor variation in their hydrological or tidal regimes causes noticeable mortality. Each species of mangrove (but particularly those belonging to the genera Rhizophora, Bruguiera, Sonneratia, Heritiera and Nypa) occurs in ecological conditions that approach its limit of tolerance with regard to salinity of the water and soil, as well as the inundation regime. If the duration of daily immersion were to be modified by tectonic, sedimentological or hydrological events, the species either readjusts to the new conditions or succumbs to unsuitable conditions. Consequently, the use of remote sensing data for mangrove ecosystems offers excellent potential as a tool for monitoring coastal change.",

Additional pressures are being put on species that are bought and sold in the international pet trade. Some of this trade is legal and has only limited effects on insect populations.

The kinds of insects that are in greatest jeopardy from the international pet trade include species that are extremely beautiful to the human eye (mostly butterflies), extremely large (walking sticks and beetles), extremely dangerous (tarantula, scorpions, and centipedes), or used as human food (ants, grasshoppers, beetle larvae, true bugs, and others).",

      "abstract": "Tropical forests are affected by recent climate change, but detailed knowledge how forests in different regions of the tropics respond to changing climate conditions is not sufficiently studied. Our objectives were to evaluate climatic effects on the monthly cambial activity of Pinus latteri and Pinus kesiya and to determine the relationships between climatic variables (precipitation, temperature, and relative humidity) and the tree-ring widths of these two pine species. Cambial dynamics of P. latteri and P. kesiya in subtropical Thailand were studied for two consecutive growing seasons. We observed that monthly rainfall, relative humidity, soil moisture, monthly minimum temperature, and monthly mean temperature were positively related to the number of cambial cell layers and cambial zone width. Moisture in the late dry season and in the beginning of the rainy season was very important in stimulating cambial cell division after a long-term moisture deficit for more than three months. The growth responses to climate in a 128-year-long chronology of P. latteri and an 88-year-long chronology of P. kesiya were similar. Importantly, the amount of rainfall and relative humidity in April and May had positive effects on the tree-ring widths of both pine species. On the other hand, both mean monthly maximum temperature and mean monthly temperature had negative effects on tree-ring widths. P. kesiya is more susceptible to drought, as shown by its correlation with the self-calibrated Palmer drought severity index. The rising temperatures during the recent 30-year observation period clearly show that higher temperatures covered the northern and central regions of Thailand and are likely to reduce the productivity of both pine species.",

      "abstract": "Background\nThe four common soil-transmitted helminth species—Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura, and the two hookworm species Ancylostoma duodenale and Necator americanus—are endemic in South America, but their distribution, infection prevalence, and regional burden are poorly understood. We aimed to estimate the risk and number of people infected with A lumbricoides, T trichiura, and hookworm across South America.\nMethods\nWe did a systematic review of reports on the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth infection in South America published up to May 14, 2012. We extracted and georeferenced relevant survey data and did a meta-analysis of the data to assess the geographical distribution of the infection risk with Bayesian geostatistical models. We used advanced Bayesian variable selection to identify environmental determinants that govern the distribution of soil-transmitted helminth infections.\nFindings\nWe screened 4085 scientific papers and identified 174 articles containing relevant survey prevalence data. We georeferenced 6948 survey locations and entered the data into the open-access Global Neglected Tropical Diseases database. Survey data were sparse for the south of the continent and for the western coast, and we identified no relevant information for Uruguay and little data for smaller countries such as Suriname, Guyana, French Guiana, and Ecuador. Population-adjusted prevalence of infection with A lumbricoides was 15·6%, with T trichiura was 12·5%, and with hookworm was 11·9% from 2005 onwards. Risks of contracting soil-transmitted helminth infection have substantially reduced since 2005 (odds ratio 0·47 [95% Bayesian credible interval 0·46–0·47] for A lumbricoides, 0·54 [0·54–0·55] for T trichiura, and 0·58 [0·58–0·59] for hookworm infection).\nInterpretation\nOur findings offer important baseline support for spatial targeting of soil-transmitted helminthiasis control, and suggest that more information about the prevalence of soil-transmitted helminth infection is needed, especially in countries in which we estimate prevalence of infection to be high but for which current data are scarce.\nFunding\nUBS Optimus Foundation and Brazilian Swiss Joint Research Programme (BSJRP 011008).",

      "abstract": "Bats are ecologically important mammals in tropical ecosystems; however, their populations face numerous environmental threats related to climate change, habitat loss, fragmentation, hunting, and emerging diseases. Thus, there is a pressing need to develop and implement large-scale networks to monitor trends in bat populations over extended time periods. Using data from a range of Neotropical and Paleotropical bat assemblages, we assessed the ability for long-term monitoring programs to reliably detect temporal trends in species abundance. We explored the magnitude of within-site temporal variation in abundance and evaluated the statistical power of a suite of different sampling designs for several different bat species and ensembles. Despite pronounced temporal variation in abundance of most tropical bat species, power simulations suggest that long-term monitoring programs (⩾20years) can detect population trends of 5% per year or more with adequate statistical power (⩾0.9). However, shorter monitoring programs (⩽10years) have insufficient power for trend detection. Overall, our analyses demonstrate that a monitoring program extending over 20years with four surveys conducted biennially on five plots per monitoring site would have the potential for detecting a 5% annual change in abundance for a suite of bat species from different ensembles. The likelihood of reaching adequate statistical power was sensitive to initial species abundance and the magnitude of count variation, stressing that only the most abundant species in an assemblage and those with generally low variation in abundance should be considered for detailed population monitoring.",

      "abstract": "We investigate the redistribution of terrigenous materials in the northeastern (NE) South American continental margin during slowdown events of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The compilation of stratigraphic data from 108 marine sediment cores collected across the western tropical Atlantic shows an extreme rise in sedimentation rates off the Parnaíba River mouth (about 2°S) during Heinrich Stadial 1 (HS1, 18–15 ka). Sediment core GeoB16206-1, raised offshore the Parnaíba River mouth, documents relatively constant 143Nd/144Nd values (expressed as εNd(0)) throughout the last 30 ka. Whereas the homogeneous εNd(0) data support the input of fluvial sediments by the Parnaíba River from the same source area directly onshore, the increases in Fe/Ca, Al/Si and Rb/Sr during HS1 indicate a marked intensification of fluvial erosion in the Parnaíba River drainage basin. In contrast, the εNd(0) values from sediment core GeoB16224-1 collected off French Guiana (about 7°N) suggest Amazon-sourced materials within the last 30 ka. We attribute the extremely high volume of terrigenous sediments deposited offshore the Parnaíba River mouth during HS1 to (i) an enhanced precipitation in the catchment region and (ii) a reduced North Brazil Current, which are both associated with a weakened AMOC.",

      "abstract": "Stable isotopes in gibbsite and kaolinite were analyzed to reconstruct the Amazonia palaeoclimate during the Cenozoic and to investigate the environmental conditions of the weathering process and the origin of the Oxisol that cover the lateritic/bauxite crust. At least two types of kaolinite were identified in the Oxisol; near the surface, the kaolinite is less fractionated and was developed at a higher temperature (35°C). This is probably due to the effect of vegetation and/or evapotranspiration or is a consequence of surface microenvironmental conditions or allochthonous inputs. The other kaolinite samples ranged in formation temperatures from 21°C to 26°C and developed under conditions similar to the Pleistocene and the modern climate of Amazonia. At least two types of gibbsite were found. One type developed in the modern Amazonia climate, in a way similar to most kaolinite samples, whereas the samples of the other type are more fractionated. This is because they may have been formed in low recycling rainwater and/or under a low amount of precipitation. These two conditions indicate a seasonal climate for bauxite development that can be linked to the low exhumation of the Andes cordillera and its geographical position relative to the Trombetas region during the period ranging from the Late Oligocene to the Early Miocene. At the end of the Cenozoic, the climate was less seasonal and wetter and the temperature was lower In addition, there was the probable inland position of the Trombetas region, which allowed Oxisol development. The gibbsite developed earlier than the kaolinite of the Oxisol, but there is a partial inheritance, or temporal equivalence, among the bauxite horizon and the Oxisol, as well as multiple generations of gibbsite and kaolinite, which is to be expected for materials developing over long periods in hard leaching conditions.",

      "abstract": "We use first field-based observations of precipitation and river isotopic chemistry from a three-year study (2009–2011) in rainforest and nearby savannah in central Guyana at the northern rim of the Amazon rainforest to establish the quality of modelled or remotely-sensed datasets. Our 3 years of data capture a reduced rainfall regime in 2009 and an extended wet season in 2010, in contrast to the widely documented Amazonian floods in 2009 and droughts in 2010. Comparisons of observed precipitation with satellite derived TRMM and ECMWF ERA-Interim reanalysis precipitation show that both of these data sets capture the general pattern of seasonality, but substantially underestimate rainfall amounts in the primary wet season (by up to 50% and 72% respectively). The TRMM dataset is generally better at characterising the main dry season from September to December but the ERA-Interim model can overestimate precipitation in the dry season by up to 175%. Our new data on isotopic chemistry of river waters show that δ2H/δ18O values in this region are broadly consistent with interpolated global datasets of modelled precipitation isotopic signatures. The dominance of isotopically lighter water derived from the rains of the ITCZ during the wet season provides evidence of the close coupling of water chemistry of headwater rivers on the northern rim of Amazonia to the positioning of the ITCZ over the region. Our results highlight the challenge in understanding and representing local scale hydrological and biogeochemical characteristics using regional scale model data. We argue that combining point and local scale field data with larger scale model data is necessary to progress towards a comprehensive understanding of climate–hydrology interactions in Amazonia.",

      "abstract": "The giant otter, Pteronura brasiliensis, occupies a range including the major drainage basins of South America, yet the degree of structure that exists within and among populations inhabiting these drainages is unknown. We sequenced portions of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) cytochrome b (612bp) and control region (383bp) genes in order to determine patterns of genetic variation within the species. We found high levels of mtDNA haplotype diversity (h=0.93 overall) and support for subdivision into four distinct groups of populations, representing important centers of genetic diversity and useful units for prioritizing conservation within the giant otter. We tested these results against the predictions of three hypotheses of Amazonian diversification (Pleistocene Refugia, Paleogeography, and Hydrogeology). While the phylogeographic pattern conformed to the predictions of the Refugia Hypothesis, molecular dating using a relaxed clock revealed the phylogroups diverged from one another between 1.69 and 0.84Ma, ruling out the influence of Late Pleistocene glacial refugia. However, the role of Plio-Pleistocene climate change could not be rejected. While the molecular dating also makes the influence of geological arches according to the Paleogeography Hypothesis extremely unlikely, the recent Pliocene formation of the Fitzcarrald Arch and its effect of subsequently altering drainage pattern could not be rejected. The data presented here support the interactions of both climatic and hydrological changes resulting from geological activity in the Plio-Pleistocene, in shaping the phylogeographic structure of the giant otter.",

      "abstract": "We determined individual nest placement patterns for female leatherbacks nesting at Awa:la-Ya:lima:po, French Guiana, by measuring distance from the nest to several landscape features, such as the highest spring tide line (HSTL) and the vegetation line. Distance from the nest to the HSTL differed significantly between females, indicating the existence of individual nesting patterns. There was a significant repeatability of nest site choice relative to the HSTL, indicating that females showed within-individual consistency in their nest placement. Despite individual preferences, there was much within-individual variation and a lack of predictability in the nesting patterns; that is, the locations of subsequent nests could not be predicted based on knowledge of previous nest choices, indicating a certain degree of scatter. The significant repeatability suggests that nest choice behaviour in female leatherbacks is heritable and may show the potential for further evolution. We tested sea-finding ability of hatchlings, a potential consequence of nest site choice, in Matapica, Suriname, by using orientation arenas to quantify the strength and direction of travel after emergence. The orientation tests showed that hatchlings were unable to move seaward in vegetated arenas, providing evidence that vegetation acts as a strong selective pressure driving nest placement seaward. It appears that leatherbacks have adopted a regional rather than a local optimum for nest placement patterns, possibly resulting from their weak beach fidelity and the frequent erosion and destruction of their nesting beaches. We discuss the evolutionary and conservation implications for this species in the context of current environmental changes.",

      "abstract": "Bridges are the most vulnerable assets of our transport networks. They are disproportionately exposed to and hit by multiple natural hazards, with flooding being the leading cause of bridge failures in the world. Their performance is constantly challenged by the combined effects of natural hazard stressors, e.g. flash floods, exacerbated by climate change, ageing, increasing traffic volumes and loads. Bridges are vulnerable to scour and other flood-related impacts, such as hydraulic forces and debris accumulation. In order to assess and quantify the resilience of flood-critical bridges and subsequently deploy bridge resilience models aiming at building resilience into transport networks, it is essential to use reliable fragility, capacity restoration and traffic reinstatement metrics and models. It is surprising that, despite the importance of bridges and their high vulnerability to hydraulic actions, there are no available recovery models. The latter can help quantify the pace of post-flood capacity and functionality gain for facilitating well-informed decision making for reliable prioritisation and efficient allocation of resources in transport networks. The main barrier is the nature and complexity of recovery actions, which encompass engineering, operational, owner resources and organisational challenges, among others. This paper, for the first time in the international literature, aims at filling this gap by generating a set of reliable recovery models that include both bridge reinstatement (traffic capacity) and restoration (structural capacity) models based on a detailed questionnaire that elicits knowledge from experts. Recovery models are then presented and validated for spread and deep foundations for a typical reinforced concrete bridge, including restoration task prioritisation and scheduling, inter-task dependencies, idle times, durations and cost ratios for different damage levels, as well as the evolution of traffic capacity after floods.",

      "abstract": "Forest canopies are dynamic interfaces between organisms and atmosphere, providing buffered microclimates and complex microhabitats. Canopies form vertically stratified ecosystems interconnected with other strata. Some forest biodiversity patterns and food webs have been documented and measurements of ecophysiology and biogeochemical cycling have allowed analyses of large-scale transfer of CO2, water, and trace gases between forests and the atmosphere. However, many knowledge gaps remain. With global research networks and databases, and new technologies and infrastructure, we envisage rapid advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that drive the spatial and temporal dynamics of forests and their canopies. Such understanding is vital for the successful management and conservation of global forests and the ecosystem services they provide to the world.",

Foodborne diseases are an important cause of morbidity and mortality. The types of diseases and their impacts are diverse in different communities and on public health. The estimated global burden of foodborne disease is considerable for each region, but it is impossible to be fully aware of all unsafe foods that cause illness. A portion of foodborne disease is recognized and reported to public health authorities and recorded in official disease statistics.

      "abstract": "Research has repeatedly shown that ongoing habitat loss and the increasing frequency of extreme climatic events have altered fundamental biological processes, threatening biodiversity and ecosystem functioning worldwide. However, the multitude of interacting factors underlying the impacts of these threats remain poorly understood in tropical forests. This is unfortunate because the majority of terrestrial biodiversity resides in these habitats. The responses of organisms to environmental changes are often studied indirectly, for example, using discrete snapshots at different time periods at the same location. This is due to the challenges of compiling long-term data, especially for invertebrates. Evaluating how functionally important species assemblages will respond to anthropogenic threats requires continuous long-term monitoring. This is vital for arthropods because they are responsible for crucial ecosystem services and human food security. Here, we review existing arthropod monitoring schemes and consider some innovative avenues for future research that promise to improve monitoring of this important group in tropical systems.",

      "abstract": "Background\nTungiasis is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) found in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. Despite the high frequency in marginalized populations, little information is available on the geography and estimates of the population at risk in endemic regions. Here we used a geostatistical model to map the potential geographic distribution of areas suitable for tungiasis transmission in Latin America and estimated the at-risk population.\nMethods\nWe developed an ecological niche model (ENM) using tungiasis occurrence records and remotely sensed environmental and socioeconomic data. The potential geographic distribution was then compared to the current population distribution of the region to derive the total population living in urban and rural areas.\nFindings\nWe identified a total of 138 records of occurrences of tungiasis in Latin America, ranging from Mexico to Argentina; 27 reports were not included in the modeling, due to missing detailed geographic information. The occurrences with detailed geographic information (n = 112) included 17 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. The locations were in environments that primarily consisted of forests (29%), croplands (16•5%), and shrublands (10•9%). We predicted environmentally suitable areas for tungiasis transmission in 45 countries. The estimated human population living in these areas is 450,546,547 with urban centers accounting for 347,007,103 and rural areas 103,539,444. Countries with significant ecological suitability and documented occurrences include Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, Argentina, Bolivia, Ecuador, French Guyana, Guatemala, Haiti, Paraguay, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela.\nInterpretation\nThis is the first study mapping the potential distribution of tungiasis in Latin America, evidencing the need for population-based studies and elaboration of integrated control measures.\nFunding\nThis project was supported in part by an appointment to the Research Participation Program at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention administered by the Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education through an interagency agreement between the U.S. Department of Energy and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",

      "abstract": "Globally, sea levels are rising due to climate change which would influence the salinity levels in mangroves. In the framework of this study, we focused on the influence of salinity and differences of forest structure on the fine root biomass (FRB) and carbon stocks in the Sundarbans mangrove forest, Bangladesh. Also, the relationships FRB to different stand structural parameters were investigated using the data obtained from 50 sample plots (100 sq. m each) in different salinity zones in Sundarbans. Four random soil samples (30 cm in length) were taken within study plots, which were further divided into 10 cm, 20 cm, and 30 cm to identify the most active soil layer for FRB stocks. Results suggest differences in forest structural parameters and diversity indices with salinity changes in different saline zones. The low and medium saline zone is dominated by Heriteira fomes, while Excoecaria agallocha dominates the high saline zone. The carbon stocks (Mg C ha−1) in Sundarbans show a significant decrease with increasing salinity in different saline zones, e.g. oligohaline (252 ± 60.2), mesohaline (199 ± 37.7), and polyhaline (171 ± 20.0) zone. FRB carbon (Mg C ha−1) allocation in different saline zones also followed a decreasing order, such as oligohaline (12.8), mesohaline (7.9), and polyhaline (7.3). Fine root biomass showed a decreasing trend with increasing soil depth, where the differences, however, were not significant (p > 0.05) among the soil layers. Our results provide evidence on FRB variations in Sundarbans, which has implications on the mangrove species conservation and management. The mature stands at different saline zones of Sundarbans mangrove forest, Bangladesh has a high fine root biomass, which is valuable for mangrove restoration and the studied species plantation in the shore line or coastal area which can help to decrease the erosion effects of tidal inundation.",

      "abstract": "The Caribbean nation of Suriname has historically depended on a mix of hydropower and oil-based fossil fuels for meeting electricity needs. Continued reliance on fossil fuels poses challenges both for climate change mitigation and for energy security. This paper explores the potential for increasing the share of renewables in Suriname's electricity mix, with a special focus on the complementary role of existing hydropower and future wind power infrastructure. We show that these resources have great synergetic potential for displacing fossil fuel-based power generation. Flexible operation of the Afobaka hydropower plant, newly in full possession of Suriname, allows significant wind power integration without violating grid stability and associated power quality requirements. Considering the trade-off between displacing expensive fossil fuels and limiting wind power curtailment on Suriname's island-like grid, our results suggest that integrating wind power in the Surinamese electricity mix is economically advantageous up to a share of 20–30%, independently of near-term demand growth. These results have wider relevance for climate policy in various Caribbean countries and other island states with existing hydropower infrastructure and substantial wind/solar power potential, for which this study fills an important literature gap.",

      "abstract": "The Demerara plateau, located offshore French Guiana and Suriname, is part of a passive transform continental margin particularly prone to develop slope instabilities, probably in relation to the presence of a free distal border along its steep continental slope. Slope failure occurred at different periods (Cretaceous to Neogene) and shows an overall retrogressive evolution through time. Upslope these failure headscarp, an enigmatic regional Mio-Pliocene unconformity has been discovered through the interpretation of new academic and industrial datasets. The aim of this work is to describe and understand the origin of this surface. Our analysis shows that this unconformity is made of a series of valleys that cross-cut sedimentary strata. Each one of these valleys has a short lateral extent and is closed along two perpendicular directions, which suggests that it could correspond to a highly meandering system, or to some sub-circular depressions. The infill of these features is equivalent to the regional stratigraphic strata found outside the structures, but in a subdued position. This seems to imply that the structures have originated by a local loss of sediments at their base or by sliding processes. Furthermore, these depressions intersect each other through time, while migrating progressively downslope. We discuss a series of hypotheses that try to explain the onset and evolution of these depressions forming the Mio-Pliocene unconformity (Canyons? Slope failures? Contourite moats? Hydrate pockmarks?). Having established that these structures are depressions formed by collapse, and have many similarities with structures recently described in the literature as pockmarks associated with gas hydrate dissolution, we favor this hypothesis. We propose that these hydrate pockmarks form with a mass failure that was triggered by fluid-overpressure development at the base of the hydrate stability zone.",

      "abstract": "Large Igneous Provinces (LIPs) are exceptionally voluminous magmatic events frequently related to continental break-up, global climate changes and mass extinctions. One interesting aspect of many LIPs is their spatial proximity to cratons, begging the question of a potential control of thick lithosphere on their emplacement. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the emplacement of the Central Atlantic Magmatic Province (CAMP) and the thick lithospheric mantle of the Precambrian cratons that formed the central portion of Pangea and are currently located on the continents surrounding the Central Atlantic Ocean. CAMP outcrops are frequently located over the margins of the thick cratonic keels, as imaged by recent tomographic studies, suggesting a role of lithosphere architecture in controlling magma genesis and emplacement. Here we focus on CAMP dykes and sills from the Hank, Hodh, and Kaarta basins in North-Western Africa (NW-Africa, Mali and Mauritania) emplaced at the edge of the Reguibat and Leo-Man Shields. The investigated intrusive rocks show compositions similar to most CAMP magmas, in particular those of the Tiourjdal geochemical group, limited to NW-Africa, and of the Prevalent group, occurring all over the CAMP. Geochemical modelling of CAMP basalts requires a Depleted MORB Mantle (DMM) source enriched by recycled continental crust (1-4%) and melting beneath a lithosphere of ca. 80 km in thickness. On the contrary, melting under a significantly thicker lithosphere (>110 km) does not produce magmas with compositions similar to those of CAMP basalts. This suggests that CAMP magmatism was likely favoured by decompression-induced partial melting of the upwelling asthenospheric mantle along the steep lithospheric boundaries of stable cratons. The architecture of the pre-existing lithosphere (i.e., the presence of stable thick cratonic keels juxtaposed to relatively thinner lithosphere) appears to have been a critical factor for localizing mantle upwelling and partial melting during extensive magmatic events such as in the CAMP.",

      "abstract": "Mangrove forests rank as one of the world's most productive biomes and their soils are highly efficient in accumulating organic carbon (OC). Most research on OC in mangrove forests has focused on moist tropical and sub-tropical regions. Here we examine an arid mangrove forest (composed of the species Avicennia marina) from the Jask area in southern Iran. The organic carbon content, TOC:TN ratios and δ13C signatures indicate that marine algae and microalgae are a greater source of organic material than the terrestrial inputs at three out of the four study sites in this work. Furthermore, sea-level rise as well as geomorphic and topographic differences are contributing to the mangrove landward migration and expansion of 112 ha (or 33%) of these arid forests between 1956 and 2012. This is substantial as up to 0.60 g OC cm−2 were found in the upper 42 cm of the soils. However, these values should be taken with caution as the large inorganic carbon deposition in the soils here and in other regions may offset the CO2 sequestration of the global arid mangroves in terms of climate mitigation.",

      "abstract": "We review literature relevant to assessing the future of tropical forests and supplement the review with new data from the lowlands of Venezuela. Compared to today, future tropical forests will have a higher level of novelty, defined as the degree of dissimilarity of a system relative to a historical baseline. Processes of succession and evolution generate novelty in forests and have done so for millennia. Under increasing human activity and climate change, the rate of generation of novelty has increased and the resulting forests are termed novel forests to distinguish them from historical forests. Historical forests are less exposed to anthropogenic disturbances and operate at slower levels of novelty generation. Acclimation, adaptation, changes in species composition and dominance, and changes in the proportions of species in communities are the responses of the biota to climate change and anthropogenic disturbances. Therefore, novelty contributes to the persistence of tropical forests in spite of increasing levels of human activity. Novel forests are similar to historical forests in terms of structure but they are younger, they have a faster turnover of mass and chemical elements, and different species composition. Historical species assemblages cannot cope with the altered environments that result from chronic anthropogenic disturbances. The dominant species in novel forests tend to be, and function as, pioneer species. High levels of species dominance in novel forests influence the proportions of chemical elements, which when coupled to species traits and attributes, help explain how novel forests cope with the conditions that result from anthropogenic activities. Novelty is more common in the tropics than in other latitudinal regions, and within the tropics, it is more common in islands where human activity is more intense than in continents. Novel tropical forests in islands have greater representation and dominance of introduced species than novel forests in continents, where native species with wide geographic distributions dominate. Regardless of geography, novel tropical forests share similar attributes and functioning. The adaptability of novel forests to extreme conditions created by human activity signals a future for tropical forests that is different from predictions of constant degradation, homogenization, and loss of biodiversity. Instead, a process of recombination of species (all taxa) into new species assemblages maintains structure, function, physiognomy, species richness, and ecological services. This remixing initially involves loss of large organisms, certain groups of species, and loss of old-growth attributes of forests. Some of these losses can be reversed through succession, assuming there is sufficient time to restore depleted stores such as soil organic matter. Continued environmental change will stimulate continued remixing of species, loss of vulnerable species, gains of less vulnerable ones, and more dissimilarity with historical forests. Novel forests are an answer to the changes induced by climate change and other anthropogenic disturbances, and as such require conservation measures, because as they mature, novel forests usually diversify and help restore lost biodiversity. We also review strategies to conserve biodiversity and optimize ecological services using novel forest succession.",

      "abstract": "In this article, numerical experiments are performed to investigate the effects of increasing atmospheric moisture on the precipitation depth (PD) produced by Hurricane Ivan (2004) over a target area, chosen as the drainage basin of the city of Asheville, NC. Atmospheric moisture was increased indirectly by increasing the sea surface temperature (SST) in the simulation initial conditions, and by letting the regional atmospheric model adjust the atmospheric fields to the SST perturbation. The SST was increased in two ways: 1) using spatially constant increments and 2) using a climate change perturbation field obtained from a climate projection. For each SST scenario, the PD over the target area was maximized by using a physically based storm transposition method. Although the mean PD, that was obtained by averaging over all shifting increments, increased with SST, the maximum PD was obtained for the case of no SST increase. It was found that, in the case of no SST increase, the worst-case tropical cyclone track was significantly different than in the SST increase scenarios. In particular, in this case, the storm spent a longer time in the simulation inner domain, thus spawning a larger PD over the target area.",

      "abstract": "The green credentials of hydroelectricity in terms of greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions have been tarnished with the finding of the researches on GHG emissions from hydroelectric reservoirs in the last two decades. Substantial amounts of GHGs release from the tropical reservoirs, especially methane (CH4) from Brazil’s Amazonian areas. CH4 contributes strongly to climate change because it has a global warming potential (GWP) 24times higher than carbon dioxide (CO2) on a per molecule basis over a 100-year time horizon. GHGs may emit from reservoirs through four different pathways to the atmosphere: (1) diffusive flux at the reservoir surface, (2) gas bubble flux in the shallow zones of a reservoir, (3) water degassing flux at the outlet of the powerhouse downstream of turbines and spillways, and (4) flux across the air–water interface in the rivers downstream of the dams. This paper reviewed the productions and emissions of CH4, CO2, and N2O in reservoirs, and the environmental variables influencing CH4 and CO2 emissions were also summarized. Moreover, the paper combined with the progress of GHG emissions from Three Gorges Reservoir and proposed three crucial problems to be resolved on GHG emissions from reservoirs at present, which would be benefit to estimate the total GHG emissions from Three Gorges Reservoir accurately.",

      "abstract": "Introduction\nNeglected tropical diseases (NTDs) in developing countries like the Caribbean, negatively affect multiple income-generating sectors, including the tourism industry upon which island states are highly dependent. Insect-transmitted NTDs include, but are not limited to, malaria, dengue and lymphatic filariasis. Control measures for these disease, are often ignored because of the associated cost. Many of the developing country members are thus retained in a financially crippling cycle, balancing the cost of prophylactic measures with that of controlling an outbreak. The purpose of the paper is to bring awareness to NTDs transmitted by insects of importance to humans, and to assess factors affecting such control, in the English-speaking Caribbean.\nMethod\nComprehensive literature review on reports pertaining to NTDs transmitted by insects in the Caribbean and Latin America was conducted. Data search was carried out on PubMed, and WHO and PAHO websites.\nResults and conclusion\nPotential risk factors for NTDs transmitted by arthropods in the English-speaking Caribbean are summarised. The mosquito appears to be the main insect-vector of human importance within the region of concern. Arthropod-vectors of diseases of veterinary importance are also relevant because they affect the livelihood of farmers, in highly agriculture based economies. Other NTDs may also be in circulation gauged by the presence of antibodies in Caribbean individuals. However, routine diagnostic tests for specific diseases are expensive and tests may not be conducted when diseases are not prevalent in the population. It appears that only a few English-speaking Caribbean countries have examined secondary reservoirs of pathogens or assessed the effectivity of their insect control methods. As such, disease risk assessment appears incomplete. Although continuous control is financially demanding, an integrated and multisectoral approach might help to deflect the cost. Such interventions are now being promoted by health agencies within the region and various countries are creating and exploring the use of novel tools to be incorporated in their insect-vector control programmes.",

      "abstract": "The combined effects of isolation within an unfavourable matrix and vegetation development were studied in patches of scrub vegetation on a tropical inselberg (Nouragues, French Guiana). Three thickets ∼10m2 area were sampled, located at ∼30m distance from each other, in which the same vegetation types were present at less than 3m distance: canopies of Clusia minor (Clusiaceae) and Myrcia saxatilis (Myrtaceae), two stages of thicket development, and zones of destruction by fire. The shallow organic soil was sampled over ∼2dm2 and down to 10cm. The matrix was comprised of granite without any soil development. Arthropods were classified into morphospecies and their food diets were characterized by optical methods. The effect of isolation (between-thicket variation) on morphospecies composition was negligible, while that of vegetation type and fire (within-thicket variation) was prominent, as ascertained by principal component analysis and tested by partial redundance analysis. The importance of keystone structures (stages of vegetation development) was stressed, and interpreted to the light of taxonomic and foodweb knowledge.",

      "abstract": "Background\nCutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) has traditionally been underrecognized and underreported. Improved awareness is warranted as the number of cases has increased as a result of increased travel to endemic countries, the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and the larger number of military and contract workers deployed overseas.\nObjective\nWe sought to present a systematic review of evidence from a gamut of research trials on the treatment efficacy of different regimens and aggregate this knowledge for use as a guide for clinical practice decisions.\nMethods\nWe performed a comprehensive search of print and electronic sources to identify the accumulated research information on New World CL.\nResults\nTopical treatment of New World CL lesions is generally not recommended. Findings support the systemic administration of pentavalent antimonials as first-line treatment. Exception to this is infection with L guyanensis in French Guiana where systemic pentamidine is suggested as first-line treatment.\nLimitations\nThe reliability of the findings of this review of research evidence is dependent on the individual quality and potential bias in its component principal trials. There was a conscious attempt to only include evidence derived from randomized controlled studies, with adequate randomization, adequate patient numbers, and complete follow-up information. However, because of the relatively small number of such studies on New World CL, evidence from nonrandomized studies and case series studies was also considered.\nConclusions\nThe pentavalent antimony compounds remain the first-line treatment choice for the treatment of New World CL. Concerns with cost, availability, poor compliance, and systemic toxicity, however, may compel clinicians to opt for alternative treatment modalities. Some advances in the development of an antileishmanial vaccine have been made but none is yet available for clinic use. The increase, over recent years, in the incidence of CL warrants an enhanced effort to increase awareness of the disease, assure timely diagnosis, and implement effective management and treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "The effects of climate change on the lowland vegetation of Amazonia during the last glacial cycle are partially known for the middle and late Pleniglacial intervals (late MIS 3, 59–24 ka and MIS 2, 24–11 ka), but are still unclear for older stages of the last glacial and during the last interglacial. It is known that a more seasonal dry-wet climate caused marginal forest retraction and together with cooling rearranged forest composition to some extent. This is observed in pollen records across Amazonia depicting presence of taxa at glacial times in localities where they do not live presently. The understanding of taxa migration is hindered by the lack of continuous interglacial-glacial lowland records. We present new data from a known locality in NW Amazonia (Six Lakes Hill), showing a vegetation record that probably started during MIS 5 (130–71 ka) and lasted until the onset of the Holocene. The vegetation record unravels a novel pattern in tree taxa migration: (1) from the beginning of this cycle Podocarpus and Myrsine are recorded and (2) only later do Hedyosmum and Alnus appear. The latter group is largely restricted to montane biomes or more distant locations outside Amazonia, whereas the first is found in lowlands close to the study site on sandy soils. These findings imply that Podocarpus and Myrsine responded to environmental changes equally and this reflects their concomitant niche use in NW Amazonia. Temperature drop is not discarded as a trigger of internal forest composition change, but its effects are clearer later in the Pleniglacial rather than the Early Glacial. Therefore early climatic/environmental changes had a first order effect on vegetation that invoke alternative explanations. We claim last glacial climate-induced modifications on forest composition favoured the expansion of geomorphologic-soil related processes that initiated forest rearrangement.",

      "abstract": "Aridity has increased in recent decades in the Mediterranean Basin and is projected to continue to increase in the coming decades. We studied the consequences of drought on the concentrations, stoichiometries and stocks of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in leaves, foliar litter of a three dominant woody species and soil of a Mediterranean montane holm oak forest where soil-water content was experimentally reduced (15 % lower than the control plots) for 15 years. Nitrogen stocks were lower in the drought plots than in the control plots (8.81 ± 1.01 kg ha−1 in the forest canopy and 856 ± 120 kg ha−1 in the 0−15 cm soil layer), thus representing 7 and 18 % lower N stocks in the canopy and soil respectively. δ15N was consistently higher under drought conditions in all samples, indicating a general loss of N. Foliar C and K stocks were also lower but to a lesser extent than N. Decreases in biomass and C and N stocks due to drought were smallest for the most dominant tall shrub, Phillyrea latifolia, so our results suggest a lower capacity of this forest to store C and nutrients but also substantial resulting changes in forest structure with increasing drought.",

      "abstract": "Parties to the Paris Agreement have a binding obligation to collectively limit global temperature rises to an agreed upon target. Commitments include providing national greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory reports to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (‘UNFCCC’) secretariat, reporting their contributions towards the collective target. GHG emissions from upstream oil and gas (O&G) facilities, including those in offshore areas under coastal State jurisdiction (where current activity is occurring in over 50 countries), are to be included within the scope of these reports. Parties to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (‘UNCLOS’) are obligated to adopt and enforce laws and regulations to prevent, reduce, and control pollution arising from seabed exploration and exploitation activities under their jurisdiction. These are to be no less effective than international rules and standards as established through competent international organisations. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), via the Regional Seas Programmes (RSP), are two such organisations that develop international rules and standards covering certain aspects of offshore O&G activities. IMO treaties, rules, and standards cover GHG emissions arising from vessel-related offshore O&G activities, but emissions from O&G industry-specific activities, such as the venting and flaring of reservoir hydrocarbons, are excluded. The only other source of international law, implementing UNCLOS′ requirement, providing international rules and standards for coastal States to benchmark their laws against for the prevention of marine pollution in the form of GHG emissions from offshore O&G activities are the regional instruments of the RSP. However, as this article will show, current RSP coverage is minimal and insufficient, particularly in light of Parties' Paris Agreement and UNCLOS obligations. Examples are provided showing inconsistencies in the reporting of offshore O&G GHG emissions across national inventory reports, as well as examples of applicable requirements prescribed under various RSP instruments, or lack thereof, highlighting the deficiency of a relevant international pollution prevention rule and/or standard across all marine regions.",

      "abstract": "Between 2012 and 2015, a severe drought and the consequent decrease in water supply in the southeastern region of Brazil reached concerning levels, leading to a water crisis. This situation caused aerial exposure of some reservoirs drawdown zone. This study aims to measure methane fluxes emitted by this drawdown zone along the Funil hydropower reservoir, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It was observed that there was a temporal variation of the methane flux in the sediments exposed in the three scenarios studied: drought, flooding and full (0.43, −0.31 and −0.01 mg CH4 m-2 h-1, respectively). The CH4 flux by area in the scenario with the highest exposed sediment area was 0.195 ton CH4 d-1. Considering the values recorded, the contribution of these emissions must become considered in the overall balance of methane in the atmosphere as a new pathway by reservoirs, mainly with the expected forecasts and possible cycles of droughts that may occur frequently. However, the temporal variability of these fluxes indicated the need for future monitoring initiatives that seek to understand how climate change affects the biochemical processes within the exposed sediments of drawdown zones.",

      "abstract": "Although some associations between the leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea and the Gulf Stream current have been previously suggested, no study has to date demonstrated strong affinities between leatherback movements and this particular frontal system using thorough oceanographic data in both the horizontal and vertical dimensions. The importance of the Gulf Stream frontal system in the selection of high residence time (HRT) areas by the North Atlantic leatherback turtle is assessed here for the first time using state-of-the-art ocean reanalysis products. Ten adult females from the Eastern French Guianese rookery were satellite tracked during post-nesting migration to relate (1) their horizontal movements to physical gradients (Sea Surface Temperature (SST), Sea Surface Height (SSH) and filaments) and biological variables (micronekton and chlorophyll a), and (2) their diving behaviour to vertical structures within the water column (mixed layer, thermocline, halocline and nutricline). All the turtles migrated northward towards the Gulf Stream north wall. Although their HRT areas were geographically remote (spread between 80–30°W and 28–45 °N), all the turtles targeted similar habitats in terms of physical structures, i.e. strong gradients of SST, SSH and a deep mixed layer. This close association with the Gulf Stream frontal system highlights the first substantial synchronization ever observed in this species, as the HRTs were observed in close match with the autumn phytoplankton bloom. Turtles remained within the enriched mixed layer at depths of 38.5±7.9m when diving in HRT areas, likely to have an easier access to their prey and maximize therefore the energy gain. These depths were shallow in comparison to those attained within the thermocline (82.4±5.6m) while crossing the nutrient-poor subtropical gyre, probably to reach cooler temperatures and save energy during the transit. In a context of climate change, anticipating the evolution of such frontal structure under the influence of global warming is crucial to ensure the conservation of this vulnerable species.",

      "abstract": "Changes in above-ground biomass (AGB) of 17 1ha logged plots of terra firme rain forest in the eastern Amazon (Brazil, Paragominas) were monitored for four years (2004–2008) after reduced-impact logging. Over the same time period, we also monitored two 0.5ha plots in adjacent unlogged forest. While AGB in the control plots changed little over the observation period (increased on average 1.4Mgha−1), logging resulted in immediate reductions in ABG that averaged 94.5Mgha−1 (±42.0), which represented 23% of the 410Mgha−1 (±64.9) present just prior to harvesting. Felled trees (dbh>55cm) accounted for 73% (±15) of these immediate losses but only 18.9Mgha−1 (±8.1) of biomass was removed in the extracted logs. During the first year after logging, the annual AGB balance (annual AGB gain by recruitment and growth−annual AGB loss by mortality) remained negative (−31.1Mgha−1year−1; ±16.7), mainly due to continued high mortality rates of damaged trees. During the following three years (2005–2008), average net AGB accumulation in the logged plots was 2.6Mgha−1year−1 (±4.6). Post-logging biomass recovery was mostly through growth (4.3±1.5Mgha−1year−1 for 2004–2005 and 6.8±0.9Mgha−1year−1 for 2005–2008), particularly of large trees. In contrast, tree recruitment contributed little to the observed increases in AGB (1.1±0.6Mgha−1year−1 for 2004–2005 and 3.1±1.3Mgha−1year−1 for 2005–2008). Plots with the lowest residual basal area after logging generally continued to lose more large trees (dbh ≥70cm), and consequently showed the greatest AGB losses and the slowest overall AGB gains. If 100% AGB recovery is desired and the 30-year minimum cutting cycle defined by Brazilian law is adhered to, current logging intensities (6treesha−1) need to be reduced by 40–50%. Such a reduction in logging intensity will reduce financial incomes to loggers, but might be compensated for by the payment of environmental services through the proposed REDD (reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation) mechanism of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.",

      "abstract": "Vertebrate population densities were quantified in lowland central Guyana using line-transect censuses at three forest sites subjected to reduced-impact logging (RIL), and three adjacent unlogged sites. We censused a range of forest vertebrate species including large canopy-dwelling and terrestrial birds, three primates, one rodent and one tortoise. Two 4km transects at each site were repeatedly surveyed during the wet season of 2008 to derive population density estimates on the basis of a cumulative survey effort of 416km. RIL had ended within 16 months, and sites had been subjected to a mean extraction rate of 3.9m3ha−1, equivalent to only 1.1treesha−1. Three of the 15 vertebrate species examined here exhibited significantly different abundances at forest RIL sites, two of which were negative. Large frugivores such as primates were less abundant in sites subject to RIL, whereas smaller frugivores, granivores, folivores and insectivores were more common in logged sites. We are unable to reliably distinguish between responses of different taxonomic groups, since robust abundance metrics could only be estimated for four mammal species. Despite this, species traits including dietary guild, body mass, home range size and vertical stratification of forest use are used to explain varying responses. Our findings suggest that responsible reduced-impact logging practices in neotropical forests can be considered as a relatively benign form of forest management that can coexist with the requirements of both local economies and biodiversity conservation. However, our study sites experienced comparably low extraction rates, and detrimental effects such as hunting were low. Our results therefore provide an opportunity to scrutinise the effects of best practice logging systems, though do not necessarily represent typical circumstances across tropical forests.",

      "abstract": "Some 90% of the Guyanese population are at risk from contemporary flood hazard and the potential impacts of climate change and sea-level rise. Such risks are not the product of physical systems alone, and by using a political ecology frame the geography of flood hazard in urban environments can be seen to coevolve with political, social and economic systems. These systems are explored by a historical review which traces the roots of present vulnerability to the colonial experience, and an analysis of contemporary vulnerabilities which draws from a peri-urban and an urban case study. The case studies show that the current fashion in international donor agencies to fund ‘community sponsored development’ has missed an opportunity to enhance security through grassroots empowerment, and rather that those community organisations associated with this system have been co-opted by political elites reproducing embedded distributions of power and vulnerability.",

      "abstract": "On November 5th, 2015, the Fundão dam collapsed in Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil, releasing millions of cubic meters of mud containing mining residue into the Doce River. Two weeks later, the mud arrived to the marine environment, triggering changes in franciscana dolphin habitat, Pontoporia blainvillei, from Franciscana Management Area Ia. This is an isolated population of the most endangered cetacean species in the South Atlantic Ocean. Organohalogen compounds (OHCs) may pose a threat to this endangered population because of their endocrine disrupting properties. Hence, this study sought to determine if there were differences in the bioaccumulation profile of OHC (PCBs, DDTs, Mirex, HCB, HCHs, PBDEs, PBEB, HBBZ and MeO-BDEs) in franciscana dolphins before and after dam collapse and to build a temporal trend. Blubber of 33 stranded individuals was collected in Espírito Santo state for organohalogen assessment between 2003 and 2019. Differences were found between franciscana dolphins collected prior to and after the disaster. Additionally, significant temporal trends for organochlorine pesticides and natural and anthropogenic organobromine were detected. The increase in pesticide concentrations after 2015 is suggestive of their reavailability in the environment. The decline in organobromine over time could be due to their debromination in the marine environment and alterations in the composition of their natural producers. PCBs remained stable during the period of the study. Our findings show an increase in endocrine disruptor concentrations, which is of great concern for this endangered population.",

      "abstract": "The future of tropical biodiversity in human-dominated landscapes will be conservation and restoration of processes of seed dispersal by birds and mammals. Here the Diversity Storage Hypothesis posits that immense biological diversity resides within skewed species-abundance distributions of tropical trees, and further predicts that many species will adjust to increases of 1.5–3.0 °C anticipated from climate change by 2100. Common and widespread tropical trees (>100,000,000 individuals) may shift ranges but are unlikely to face extinction. Many rare species (e.g. <1000 individuals) have a more precarious future. The latter may be declining species bound for extinction, incipient species adjusting to environmental changes, or relics of past warmer and more seasonal climates that will be resurrected if processes of seed dispersal allow them to persist and spread. In fragmented agricultural landscapes, preserved or planted corridors, buffers and stepping-stone habitat patches around and between forest remnants are more vital than efforts to preserve or create contemporary forest compositions, dominance relations, and species-abundance distributions. An implication of Diversity Storage is that it is more important to facilitate migration into and out of changing landscapes to allow inherent diversity to adjust and coexist with agricultural economies than to resist change.",

      "abstract": "Amazonian rivers function as important barriers to dispersal of Amazonian birds. Studying population genetics of lineages separated by rivers may help us to uncover the dynamics of biological diversification in the Amazon. We reconstructed the phylogeography of the Wedge-billed Woodcreeper, Glyphorynchus spirurus (Furnariidae) in the Amazon basin. Sampling included 134 individuals from 63 sites distributed in eight Amazonian areas of endemism separated by major Amazonian rivers. Nucleotide sequences were generated for five genes: two mtDNA genes (1047bp for cyt b and 1002bp for ND2) and three nuclear genes (647bp from the sex-linked gene ACO, 319bp from the intron of G3PDH, and 619bp from intron 2 of MYO). In addition, 37 individuals were randomly selected from the Rondônia and Inambari areas of endemism for genomic fingerprinting, using five ISSR primers. Our results reveal allopatric and well-supported lineages within G. spirurus with high levels of genetic differentiation (p-distances 0.9–6.3%) across opposite banks of major Amazonian rivers. The multilocus phylogenetic reconstructions obtained reveal several incongruences with current subspecies taxonomy. Within currently recognized subspecies, we found high levels of both paraphyly and genetic differentiation, indicating deep divergences and strong isolation consistent with species-level differences. ISSR fingerprinting supports the existence of genetically differentiated populations on opposite sides of the Madeira River. Molecular dating suggests an initial vicariation event isolating populations from the Guiana center of endemism during the Late Miocene/Early Pliocene, while more recent events subdivided Brazilian Shield populations during the Lower Pleistocene.",

      "abstract": "For more than a decade, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), national governments, several United Nations agencies and regional organisations have been supporting the development, and now also the implementation of the Strategic Action Programme (SAP) for the Sustainable Management of the Shared Living Marine Resources of the Caribbean and North Brazil Shelf Large Marine Ecosystems (resp. CLME and NBSLME, jointly referred to as the CLME+ region). These Large Marine Ecosystems or LMEs provide critical ecosystem services supporting human well-being in this region, particularly for the fisheries and tourism sectors. Unsustainable fisheries, habitat degradation and pollution are three key threats to CLME+ marine ecosystems, and their effects are being exacerbated by climate change. Root causes of these threats include: weak governance; limited human and financial resources; inadequate knowledge; inadequate public awareness and participation; inadequate consideration of the value of ecosystem goods and services; population and cultural pressures; and trade and external dependency. The CLME+ SAP addresses these weaknesses through six distinct strategies aimed at strengthening regional cooperation, institutional reform, and capacity building at the regional, national and local levels over the short (0–5 years) and medium (6–10 years) term. The SAP has been endorsed at the political level by 24 countries and it will be implemented through a partnership approach: “the Global Alliance for the coordinated implementation of the CLME+ SAP” (“CLME+ SAP Alliance”).",

      "abstract": "Tropical forests are the most diverse and productive ecosystems on Earth. While better understanding of these forests is critical for our collective future, until quite recently efforts to measure and monitor them have been largely disconnected. Networking is essential to discover the answers to questions that transcend borders and the horizons of funding agencies. Here we show how a global community is responding to the challenges of tropical ecosystem research with diverse teams measuring forests tree-by-tree in thousands of long-term plots. We review the major scientific discoveries of this work and show how this process is changing tropical forest science. Our core approach involves linking long-term grassroots initiatives with standardized protocols and data management to generate robust scaled-up results. By connecting tropical researchers and elevating their status, our Social Research Network model recognises the key role of the data originator in scientific discovery. Conceived in 1999 with RAINFOR (South America), our permanent plot networks have been adapted to Africa (AfriTRON) and Southeast Asia (T-FORCES) and widely emulated worldwide. Now these multiple initiatives are integrated via ForestPlots.net cyber-infrastructure, linking colleagues from 54 countries across 24 plot networks. Collectively these are transforming understanding of tropical forests and their biospheric role. Together we have discovered how, where and why forest carbon and biodiversity are responding to climate change, and how they feedback on it. This long-term pan-tropical collaboration has revealed a large long-term carbon sink and its trends, as well as making clear which drivers are most important, which forest processes are affected, where they are changing, what the lags are, and the likely future responses of tropical forests as the climate continues to change. By leveraging a remarkably old technology, plot networks are sparking a very modern revolution in tropical forest science. In the future, humanity can benefit greatly by nurturing the grassroots communities now collectively capable of generating unique, long-term understanding of Earth's most precious forests.\nResumen\nLos bosques tropicales son los ecosistemas más diversos y productivos del mundo y entender su funcionamiento es crítico para nuestro futuro colectivo. Sin embargo, hasta hace muy poco, los esfuerzos para medirlos y monitorearlos han estado muy desconectados. El trabajo en redes es esencial para descubrir las respuestas a preguntas que trascienden las fronteras y los plazos de las agencias de financiamiento. Aquí mostramos cómo una comunidad global está respondiendo a los desafíos de la investigación en ecosistemas tropicales a través de diversos equipos realizando mediciones árbol por árbol en miles de parcelas permanentes de largo plazo. Revisamos los descubrimientos más importantes de este trabajo y discutimos cómo este proceso está cambiando la ciencia relacionada a los bosques tropicales. El enfoque central de nuestro esfuerzo implica la conexión de iniciativas locales de largo plazo con protocolos estandarizados y manejo de datos para producir resultados que se puedan trasladar a múltiples escalas. Conectando investigadores tropicales, elevando su posición y estatus, nuestro modelo de Red Social de Investigación reconoce el rol fundamental que tienen, para el descubrimiento científico, quienes generan o producen los datos. Concebida en 1999 con RAINFOR (Suramérica), nuestras redes de parcelas permanentes han sido adaptadas en África (AfriTRON) y el sureste asiático (T-FORCES) y ampliamente replicadas en el mundo. Actualmente todas estas iniciativas están integradas a través de la ciber-infraestructura de ForestPlots.net, conectando colegas de 54 países en 24 redes diferentes de parcelas. Colectivamente, estas redes están transformando nuestro conocimiento sobre los bosques tropicales y el rol de éstos en la biósfera. Juntos hemos descubierto cómo, dónde y porqué el carbono y la biodiversidad de los bosques tropicales está respondiendo al cambio climático y cómo se retroalimentan. Esta colaboración pan-tropical de largo plazo ha expuesto un gran sumidero de carbono y sus tendencias, mostrando claramente cuáles son los factores más importantes, qué procesos se ven afectados, dónde ocurren los cambios, los tiempos de reacción y las probables respuestas futuras mientras el clima continúa cambiando. Apalancando lo que realmente es una tecnología antigua, las redes de parcelas están generando una verdadera y moderna revolución en la ciencia tropical. En el futuro, la humanidad puede beneficiarse enormemente si se nutren y cultivan comunidades de investigadores de base, actualmente con la capacidad de generar información única y de largo plazo para entender los que probablemente son los bosques más preciados de la tierra.\nResumo\nFlorestas tropicais são os ecossistemas mais diversos e produtivos da Terra. Embora uma boa compreensão destas florestas seja crucial para o nosso futuro coletivo, até muito recentemente os esforços de medições e monitoramento tem sido amplamente desconexos. É essencial formarmos redes para obtermos respostas que transcendam as fronteiras e horizontes das agências financiadoras. Neste estudo nós mostramos como uma comunidade global está respondendo aos desafios da pesquisa de ecossistemas tropicais, com equipes diversas medindo florestas, árvore por árvore, em milhares de parcelas monitoradas a longo prazo. Nós revisamos as maiores descobertas científicas deste esforço global, e mostramos também como este processo vem mudando a ciência de florestas tropicais. Nossa abordagem principal envolve unir iniciativas de base a protocolos padronizados e gerenciamento de dados a fim de gerar resultados robustos em grandes escalas. Ao conectar pesquisadores tropicais e elevar seus status, nosso modelo de Rede de Pesquisa Social reconhece o papel chave do produtor dos dados na descoberta científica. Concebida em 1999 com o RAINFOR (América do Sul), nossa rede de parcelas permanentes foi adaptada para África (AfriTRON) e Sudeste Asiático (T-FORCES), e tem sido extensamente reproduzida em todo o mundo. Agora estas múltiplas iniciativas estão integradas através da infraestrutura cibernética do ForestPlots.net, conectando colegas de 54 países e 24 redes de parcelas. Estas iniciativas estão transformando coletivamente o entendimento das florestas tropicais e seus papéis na biosfera. Juntos nós descobrimos como, onde e por que o carbono e a biodiversidade da floresta estão respondendo às mudanças climáticas, e seus efeitos de retroalimentação. Esta duradoura colaboração pantropical revelou um grande sumidouro de carbono persistente e suas tendências, assim como tem evidenciado quais os fatores que influenciam essas tendências, quais processos florestais são mais afetados, onde eles estão mudando, seus atrasos no tempo de resposta, e as prováveis respostas das florestas tropicais conforme o clima continua a mudar. Dessa forma, aproveitando uma notável tecnologia antiga, redes de parcelas acendem as faíscas de uma moderna revolução na ciência das florestas tropicais. No futuro a humanidade pode se beneficiar incentivando estas comunidades locais que agora são coletivamente capazes de gerar conhecimentos únicos e duradouros sobre as florestas mais preciosas da Terra.\nRésume\nLes forêts tropicales sont les écosystèmes les plus diversifiés et les plus productifs de la planète. Si une meilleure compréhension de ces forêts est essentielle pour notre avenir collectif, jusqu'à tout récemment, les efforts déployés pour les mesurer et les surveiller ont été largement déconnectés. La mise en réseau est essentielle pour découvrir les réponses à des questions qui dépassent les frontières et les horizons des organismes de financement. Nous montrons ici comment une communauté mondiale relève les défis de la recherche sur les écosystèmes tropicaux avec diverses équipes qui mesurent les forêts arbre après arbre dans de milliers de parcelles permanentes. Nous passons en revue les principales découvertes scientifiques de ces travaux et montrons comment ce processus modifie la science des forêts tropicales. Notre approche principale consiste à relier les initiatives de base à long terme à des protocoles standardisés et une gestion de données afin de générer des résultats solides à grande échelle. En reliant les chercheurs tropicaux et en élevant leur statut, notre modèle de réseau de recherche sociale reconnaît le rôle clé de l'auteur des données dans la découverte scientifique. Conçus en 1999 avec RAINFOR (Amérique du Sud), nos réseaux de parcelles permanentes ont été adaptés à l'Afrique (AfriTRON) et à l'Asie du Sud-Est (T-FORCES) et largement imités dans le monde entier. Ces multiples initiatives sont désormais intégrées via l'infrastructure ForestPlots.net, qui relie des collègues de 54 pays à travers 24 réseaux de parcelles. Ensemble, elles transforment la compréhension des forêts tropicales et de leur rôle biosphérique. Ensemble, nous avons découvert comment, où et pourquoi le carbone forestier et la biodiversité réagissent au changement climatique, et comment ils y réagissent. Cette collaboration pan-tropicale à long terme a révélé un important puits de carbone à long terme et ses tendances, tout en mettant en évidence les facteurs les plus importants, les processus forestiers qui sont affectés, les endroits où ils changent, les décalages et les réactions futures probables des forêts tropicales à mesure que le climat continue de changer. En tirant parti d'une technologie remarquablement ancienne, les réseaux de parcelles déclenchent une révolution très moderne dans la science des forêts tropicales. À l'avenir, l'humanité pourra grandement bénéficier du soutien des communautés de base qui sont maintenant collectivement capables de générer une compréhension unique et à long terme des forêts les plus précieuses de la Terre.\nAbstrak\nHutan tropika adalah di antara ekosistem yang paling produktif dan mempunyai kepelbagaian biodiversiti yang tinggi di seluruh dunia. Walaupun pemahaman mengenai hutan tropika amat penting untuk masa depan kita, usaha-usaha untuk mengkaji dan mengawas hutah-hutan tersebut baru sekarang menjadi lebih diperhubungkan. Perangkaian adalah sangat penting untuk mencari jawapan kepada soalan-soalan yang menjangkaui sempadan dan batasan agensi pendanaan. Di sini kami menunjukkan bagaimana sebuah komuniti global bertindak balas terhadap cabaran penyelidikan ekosistem tropika melalui penglibatan pelbagai kumpulan yang mengukur hutan secara pokok demi pokok dalam beribu-ribu plot jangka panjang. Kami meninjau semula penemuan saintifik utama daripada kerja ini dan menunjukkan bagaimana proses ini sedang mengubah bidang sains hutan tropika. Teras pendekatan kami memberi tumpuan terhadap penghubungan inisiatif akar umbi jangka panjang dengan protokol standar serta pengurusan data untuk mendapatkan hasil skala besar yang kukuh. Dengan menghubungkan penyelidik-penyelidik tropika dan meningkatkan status mereka, model Rangkaian Penyelidikan Sosial kami mengiktiraf kepentingan peranan pengasas data dalam penemuan saintifik. Bermula dengan pengasasan RAINFOR (Amerika Selatan) pada tahun 1999, rangkaian-rangkaian plot kekal kami kemudian disesuaikan untuk Afrika (AfriTRON) dan Asia Tenggara (T-FORCES) dan selanjutnya telah banyak dicontohi di seluruh dunia. Kini, inisiatif-inisiatif tersebut disepadukan melalui infrastruktur siber ForestPlots.net yang menghubungkan rakan sekerja dari 54 negara di 24 buah rangkaian plot. Secara kolektif, rangkaian ini sedang mengubah pemahaman tentang hutan tropika dan peranannya dalam biosfera. Kami telah bekerjasama untuk menemukan bagaimana, di mana dan mengapa karbon serta biodiversiti hutan bertindak balas terhadap perubahan iklim dan juga bagaimana mereka saling bermaklum balas. Kolaborasi pan-tropika jangka panjang ini telah mendedahkan sebuah sinki karbon jangka panjang serta arah alirannya dan juga menjelaskan pemandu-pemandu perubahan yang terpenting, di mana dan bagaimana proses hutan terjejas, masa susul yang ada dan kemungkinan tindakbalas hutan tropika pada perubahan iklim secara berterusan di masa depan. Dengan memanfaatkan pendekatan lama, rangkaian plot sedang menyalakan revolusi yang amat moden dalam sains hutan tropika. Pada masa akan datang, manusia sejagat akan banyak mendapat manfaat jika memupuk komuniti-komuniti akar umbi yang kini berkemampuan secara kolektif menghasilkan pemahaman unik dan jangka panjang mengenai hutan-hutan yang paling berharga di dunia.",
